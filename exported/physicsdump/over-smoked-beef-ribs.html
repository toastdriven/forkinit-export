                Beef ribs - a lot, I used both ribs cut to resemble a rack of pork ribs and ribs cut into little chunks across the bone at about 2&quot;<br><br>RUB - I make my own with salt, sugar and about 7 other things. I never measure and don&#x27;t always use the same things to make it.<br><br>BBQ sauce - I used the one in my fridge. It isn&#x27;t so good by itself but works well as a glaze.<br><br>Applewood - Cherry is also really nice but my neighbor has an apple tree not a cherry tree.<br><br><br>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Firstly do your best to remove the silverskin from the back (bone side) of the racked ribs.<br><br>Then apply rub liberally and let sit for 1/2-12 hours.<br><br>Use charcoal if&#x27;n you can, I can&#x27;t figure how else it would work but many people confuse their grill with a barbecue, which few actually are.<br><br>I put the ribs over the previously lit coals, bone side down, and the apple wood chunks (these were from an eight inch long three inch across limb that I split and broke to make bits) into a vat of water.<br><br>After about 10 minutes I added a bit of the wet wood and removed another bit so it could dry slightly before I put it in for smoking.<br><br>Usually I use my firebox and don&#x27;t put the coals in the main grill area, tonight I was in a hurry and sorta faked it.<br><br>I checked the grill every 30 minutes or so, adding wood for smoke and charcoal for heat. After the meat has been on for about half an hour over the coals directly I moved it around to make for more even cooking, brazing about half of the ribs with BBQ sauce. After about one hour I moved the meat from over the coals to across the grill so it could smoke and cook slowly, re-brazing the previously brazed ribs once more.<br><br>About two hours later I removed the meat, let sit about 10 minutes and served.<br><br><br>
