            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. Boil rice noodles until soft (5-6 minutes). Drain and toss with 1 T oil to keep from sticking (or rinse with cold water).<br>2. Mix all sauce ingredients together in a cup. Set aside.<br>3. Place remaining oil in wok. Over medium-high heat, stir-fry shallots and chillies until fragrant (about 1 minute).<br>4. Add wheat gluten or tofu and stir fry (1 minute).<br>5. Add snow peas and stir-fry another minute until bright green.<br>6. If using eggs, clear a space in the center of the wok. Crack eggs into it and stir-fry until cooked.<br>7. Add noodles and sauce, then stir-fry, lifting and turning the noodles to combine all ingredients (1-2 minutes).<br>8. Taste for saltiness. If not salty enough, add up to 2 T fish or soy sauce.<br>9. Take off the heat and add bean sprouts, mixing well to combine (note that bean sprouts should retain some of their crunchiness).<br>10. To serve, place noodles on a platter. Sprinkle with spring onions, ground nuts, and coriander. For those who like it extra hot, serve with a bottle of â€œsambalâ€ (red chili sauce).
