            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                In a medium mixing bowl add almond milk, maple syrup, yeast &amp; chia/flax eggs. With a wooden spoon stir in 1 cup of all-purpose flour, 1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour and salt. Stir until a dough ball forms and pulls away from the side of the bowl. Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface and begin kneading in the remaining 1/2 cup of all-purpose flour, about 1/8 cup at a time. Knead until smooth and elastic- about 7-8 minutes. Return dough ball to an oiled bowl. Cover and allow to rise in a warm area until double in size - about 45-60 minutes.<br><br>Flour your work area and a rolling pin. Turn dough onto the floured surface and roll out into a rectangle about 12&quot; wide and 24&quot; long. Spread butter evenly over the surface of the rectangle. Sprinkle the thyme, coconut sugar, cranberries and 1 T of crystallized ginger evenly over the surface of the rectangle. Measuring with the loaf pan you are using, using a pizza cutter cut strips lengthwise as wide as the width of your pan (short side) - about 3-4 strips. Cut those strips into 4&quot; squares width wise. Layer squares on top of one another and place the stacks on their side into the buttered loaf pan (facing up). Once all stacks have been placed in the pan, cover and allow to rise for an additional 30-45 minutes or until doubled in size. Sprinkle remaining 1/2 T of crystallized ginger over the top of the loaf. Bake in preheated 350Â°F oven for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown.<br><br>Remove from oven - allow to cool on a wire rack for about 5-10 minutes. Run a knife around the edges of the pan to loosen the bread. Flip bread onto cutting board or serving plate. Serve warm with additional vegan butter, vegan cheese or straight up.
