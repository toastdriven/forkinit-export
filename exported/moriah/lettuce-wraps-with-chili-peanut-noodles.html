                Ingredient note: While bean thread packages often come in 3.75 oz sizes, you won&#x27;t use a whole package for this recipe.<br><br>1. Soften noodles in medium pot of hot water under tender, about 15 minutes. Bring noodles to a boil and cook 1 minute then drain and set aside. Using a food processor, mix together the peanut butter, brown rice syrup, garlic, shoyu or tamari, lime juice, chili sauce and the 1/3 C warm water until combined thoroughly. Dress the noodles with 1/2 C of the sauce.<br>2. Arrange all of the lettuce wrap fillings from coconut to noodles in individual serving dishes or on a large platter. Let guests create their own lettuce wraps by rolling up lettuce to eat like a taco or burrito. Serve with extra hoisin and peanut sauces for dressing.
