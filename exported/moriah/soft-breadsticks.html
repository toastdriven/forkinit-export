                The food processor method is terrific for those of us who bake frequently. Dissolve yeast in warm water in large bowl. Stir in sugar, salt, rosemary, oregano, 2 cups of the flour and the oil. Beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to make dough easy to handle (dough will be soft). <br><br>Turn dough onto lightly floured surface. Knead about 5 minutes until smooth and elastic. Place dough in greased medium bowl and turn greased side up. Cover and let rise in warm place 1-1/2 to 2 hours or until double. (Longer rising gives typical French bread texture.) <br><br>Grease large cookie sheet and sprinkle with cornmeal. Divide dough into 24 equal parts. Roll and shape each part into rope, about 9 inches long, sprinkling with flour if dough is too sticky. Place on cookie sheet. Mix egg white and 2 tablespoons cold water. Brush over breadsticks. Sprinkle with poppy seeds. <br><br>Heat oven to 400 degrees. Bake about 20 minutes or until crust is deep golden brown and crisp. Immediately remove from cookie sheets. Store loosely covered. 2 DOZEN BREADSTICKS; 65 CALORIES PER BREADSTICK <br><br>Food Processor Directions: Place warm water and yeast in food processor. Cover and process, using quick on-and-off motions, until yeast is dissolved. Add flour, sugar and salt. Process about 30 seconds or until dough forms a ball. (If dough is too sticky, add flour, 1 tablespoon at a time.) Do not knead dough. Continue as directed.
