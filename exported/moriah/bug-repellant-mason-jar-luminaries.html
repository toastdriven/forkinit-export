            <h3 class="underline">Ingredients</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                4 Mason jars (you can also recycle jelly jars, etc)<br>40 drops each – cedarwood, lavender, lemon and Thieves essential oils (or use your own combination of oils, but these are known to help to repel the buggies). This equals TEN drops of each oil/jar.<br>2 fresh lemons<br>2 fresh limes<br>8 sprigs fresh rosemary<br>Water <br>Floating tea light candles
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-8">
            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Line up 4 mason jars.<br>Slice the lemons and the limes and set aside for a moment – I like to have two each just in case but you can possibly use one each.<br>Place two sprigs of rosemary  into each jar.<br>Fill each jar 3/4 full with water.<br>Add the essential oils of your choice  – 10 drops each per jar – and swirl slightly.<br>Place a slice each of lemon and lime into each jar.<br>Add more water if needed to raise the level to almost full.<br>Place a floating tea light candle on top.<br>Set outside, light and make some magic once you light them.<br>Replace tea lights as needed – I recommend having some extras on hand!<br>Discard fruit and liquid in jar after 2 – 3 days depending on your climate; rinse jars and start fresh as needed.
