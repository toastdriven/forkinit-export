            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Boil the cream (or coconut milk) and set aside to cool to lukewarm. Add the mint or orange flavoring, if using, and stir well. Melt the cut chocolate over a double boiler. Add the cayenne and mix well.<br>Whisk the chocolate and cream (or coconut milk) together and cover. Refrigerate until mixture can be formed into small balls, about 45 minutes. Form small balls and place on a pan. Freeze the truffle balls until frozen, about 1 hour.<br>After the truffle balls are frozen, melt the chopped chocolate over a double boiler, and put into a shallow baking pan.<br>In small batches, so that they stay firm, roll the truffle balls in melted chocolate for about 5 seconds each. Shake off excess chocolate and place on a lined baking sheet, sprinkle with garnish if using. Put the finished truffles in the refrigerator.<br><br>Cook&#x27;s Note: Because the dipping chocolate has not been tempered, the truffles, if not kept refrigerated, will get a white cast or white streaks, known as blooming. This is only visual and will not affect the taste.
