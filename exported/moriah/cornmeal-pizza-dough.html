            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. To make the dough, sprinkle the yeast over the water.  Let stand 1 minute, or until the yeast is creamy.  Stir until the yeast is dissolved.<br>2. In a large bowl, combine 2 1/2 C of the flour, the cornmeal and salt.  Add the dissolved yeast and the oil.  Stir until a soft dough forms.  Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead, adding more flour if necessary, until the dough is smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes.<br>3. Lightly coat a large bowl with oil.  Place the dough in the bowl, turning it once to oil the top.  Cover with plastic wrap.  Put the bowl in a warm, draft-free place until doubled in bulk, about 2 hours.<br>4. Flatten the dough with your fist.  Cut the dough into 2 pieces and shape the pieces into balls.  Dust the tops with flour.<br>5. Place the balls on a floured surface and cover each with plastic wrap, allowing room for the dough to expand.  Let rise 1 hour, or until doubled.<br>6. Preheat the oven to 450Ã‚Â°F.  Oil two 12&quot; pizza pans.<br>7. Roll out each ball to form a 12&quot; circle.  Place the dough on the pan, top with desired toppings and bake 20-25 minutes, depending on how thick the ingredients are.<br>8. Cool, cut and serve!
