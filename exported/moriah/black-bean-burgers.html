            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Blend rice, beans, onion, and spices in a food processor until just mixed. Add flour if the mixture seems too runny to form patties. Heat olive oil in skillet, enough to cover the bottom generously. Form patties in your hand and place in heated oil (it&#x27;s okay if the patties are really sticky or mushy--cooking them will firm them up. Fry on each side for 4-5 minutes, or until brown and lightly crisped. Serve on a bun with all your favorite fixings.
