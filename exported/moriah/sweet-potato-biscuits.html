            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.  Sift the flour, baking powder, and salt into a medium-sized bowl.  Cut the butter into the flour mixture using a pastry cutter or two knives - the mixture should look like coarse meal.  Mix together the milk, sweet potatoes, and maple syrup or honey.  Pour into the flour mixture and stir with a fork until the mixture just comes together.  Turn dough out onto a floured surface and knead, using a light touch, until the dough is fairly smooth.  Use a little more flour if the dough is too sticky, remembering that short and gentle kneading will give you the most tender biscuit.  Pat the dough out to a thickness of 3/4 to 1&quot;.  Cut with a 2&quot; biscuit cutter.  Place on a lightly oiled cookie sheet.  Bake 15 minutes, or until just golden.  Serve hot!  Makes approximately 20 biscuits.
