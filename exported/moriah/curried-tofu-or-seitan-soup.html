                1. Heat stock in a soup pot over medium-low heat.  In a large nonstick skillet, heat oil over medium heat.  When hot, add onion, celery, carrot and Thyme.  Cook, stirring, for about 5 minutes, until onions are clear.  The object is not to brown the vegetables.  If that starts to happen, reduce the heat a touch.  Stir in Curry Powders, flour and honey, cook for 5 more minutes.<br>2. Add the chopped apple, stir to coat, and then add hot stock to the skillet gradually, a ladleful at a time, stirring until smooth and thickened.  Two C of stock should be all you need to add.<br>3. Carefully pour the thickened stock back into the soup pot, add potatoes, Parsley, salt, Pepper, and tofu/seitan, simmer 30 minutes or so, until potatoes are tender.  Remove from heat, slowly stir in the milk and serve.  To reheat leftover soup, bring to a simmer slowly over low heat.
