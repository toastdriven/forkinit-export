                Cake:<br>Heat the oven to 350Â°F.  Lightly oil and flour the bottoms of two 8&quot; round cake pans.<br>In a large bowl, use an electric mixer to cream the brown sugar and butter until light.  Slowly add the egg replacer and molasses, then blend well.  Beat in the buttermilk, vanilla and nutmeg.<br>In a second bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt.  Slowly add the flour mixture to the molasses mixture and mix until thoroughly incorporated.<br>Pour half of the batter into each of the prepared cake pans.  Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted at the center of each cake comes out clean.  Let the cakes cool in their pans on a wire rack.<br>While the cakes cool, make the filling.  In a medium saucepan over medium, combine the apples and water.  Cook, stirring occasionally, until the apples are tender.  Stir in the brown sugar and cinnamon.  Bring to a boil and cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens and is syrupy.<br>Place one of the cooled cake layers on a serving plate.  Spread half of the filling on top.  Place the second cake layer on top, then spread the remaining filling over it.
