            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. In a mixing bowl, hand-sift the flour with the salt. Add the water and knead to form a stiff dough, 1 to 2 minutes.<br>2. Lay the dough out on a floured surface and roll it flat using a rolling pin. Fold and roll the dough many times, adding flour to prevent sticking; folding helps form a protein structure that will allow the dough to stay together through the cooking process. If using a pasta roller, gradually decrease the thickness of the dough to the desired final thickness. If you don&#x27;t have a roller, well...just wing it. Italian grandmothers do it all the time!<br>3. If you want to make stuffed pasta, such as ravioli, you should also add 1 teaspoon olive oil to help the pasta stick to itself.  Serves 6.<br><br>*Add 1/2 C pureed spinach to make spinach pasta.  Make sure to drain well and may need to decrease water.
