            Make sure the dough is cold enough to hold its shape, but not rock hard so you can&#x27;t turn the handle and press the cookies out.  Start with a drop of two of food coloring, you can always add more.

                1. Preheat oven to 400Ã‚Â°F.<br>2. Cream butter and sugar, add egg and Vanilla.  Mix salt, Ginger and Cinnamon into flour.  Add to wet ingredients.<br>3. Knead the dough by hand until soft and pliable.  Divide dough into sections for coloring.  Flatten each section into a disc.  Put about 2 drops of food coloring in the center and knead the dough until the color is evenly distributed.<br>4. Form the dough into loaves approximately the size of the chamber of your cookie press.  If the dough is too soft to work with, chill for about 30 minutes.<br>5. Press the dough through the cookie press onto ungreased cookie sheets.  Decorate as desired with colored sugar or other decorations before baking.  Bake about 8 minutes.
