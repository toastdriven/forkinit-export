            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                2 cups (260 g of flour)<br>1 cup vegan butter (like Vegan Becel or Earth Balance)<br>1/4 cup white granulated sugar<br>1 tsp lemon zest (or all the zest of one lemon)<br>Up to 2 tsp juice from lemon
            </p>
        </div>

            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Stir the lemon zest and sugar together so that the sugar absorbs the lemony flavor. Let sit for about 10 minutes. Combine all ingredients using a food processor or a pastry cutter until a dough forms. It may be a little crumbly, if that&#x27;s the case, add a little lemon juice so that the dough sticks together a bit better. It&#x27;ll still be crumbly. Form into a rough disc and wrap in plastic film. Refrigerate for about an hour to let the dough rest.<br>Remove from fridge and roll out to 1/4&quot; thickness (a little less than 1 cm) and cut into shapes (I just did standard rectangles).<br>Refrigerate for another 10-15 minutes so that they keep their shape in the oven. Meanwhile preheat your oven to 350Â°F.<br>Bake for 10-12 minutes until you start to see the bottom edges brown. Remove from oven and let cool on a wire rack. Store in an airtight container; best eaten with tea!
