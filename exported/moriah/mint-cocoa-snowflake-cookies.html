            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. In a medium bowl, sift together flour, baking powder and salt; set aside.  In a small heavy saucepan, melt butter over low heat, add Natural Cocoa Powder and Raspberry Enlightenment; blend well with a fork or a small whisk until smooth.  Remove pan from heat; stir in sugar until combined (it will be dark brown at this point).<br>2. Transfer to a large mixing bowl, add Pure Vanilla Extract, then Egg Replacer, stirring well with a wooden spoon or hand mixer.  Add flour mixture and nuts if desired; mix well.<br>3. Cover the dough with plastic wrap; refrigerate until chilled.  The dough really should chill overnight or the finished cookies won&#x27;t be quite as puffy, but 2 hours will do in a pinch.  The dough never gets really stiff, but it rolls and bakes best when thoroughly chilled.<br>4. Preheat oven to 350Ã‚Â°F.  Grab a handful of dough, enough for a cookie sheet, leaving the rest in the fridge.<br>5. Roll each hunk of dough into a 3/4&quot; ball, then roll in Hint Of Mint Hot Chocolate Mix.  It is easier to roll the dough into balls if you coat your hands with the hot chocolate mix.  Place the sugar-coated balls onto a parchment-lined baking sheet 2&quot; apart.<br>6. Bake cookies for 10 minutes at 350Ã‚Â°F.  Let cool a minute, then remove from pan.  Store in an airtight container to maintain the soft and chewy texture of these cookies.  If you&#x27;d like a crisper cookie, bake a minute longer (be careful not to burn the bottoms).
