            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. In large mixer bowl, combine 1 C flour, oat bran, yeast and salt.  Heat water, agave and margarine until very warm (120Ã‚Â°-130Ã‚Â°F).  Add to dry ingredients; beat at low speed of electric mixer until moistened.  Increase speed to medium; continue beating 3 minutes.  Stir in enough remaining flour to form a stiff dough.<br>2. Lightly spray another large bowl with nonstick cooking spray, or oil lightly.  Turn out dough onto lightly floured surface.  Knead 8 to 10 minutes or until dough is smooth and elastic.  Place in prepared bowl, turning once to coat surface of dough.  Cover; let rise in warm place (80Ã‚Â° to 85Ã‚Â°F) 30 minutes or until doubled in size.<br>3. Lightly spray 8x4&quot; loaf pan with nonstick cooking spray, or oil lightly.  Punch down dough.  Roll into 15x7&quot; rectangle.  Starting at narrow end, roll up dough tightly.  Pinch ends and seam to seal; place, seam-side-down, in prepared pan.  Cover; let rise in warm place 30 minutes or until doubled in size.<br>4. Heat oven to 375Ã‚Â°F.  Bake 35 to 40 minutes or until golden brown.  Remove from pan; cool on wire rack at least 1 hour before slicing.
