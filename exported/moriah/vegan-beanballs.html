                2 cups cooked or one 15- to 16-oz can (drained and rinsed) pink or small red beans<br>1/2 cup quick-cooking oats or quinoa flakes<br>1/2 cup walnuts<br>Parsley leaves from a couple of sprigs<br>1/4 cup tomato sauce or organic ketchup<br>1 tablespoon olive oil or water<br>2 scallions, green parts only, coarsely chopped<br>1 teaspoon sweet paprika<br>1 teaspoons smoked paprika, mesquite, or other smoky seasoning<br>2 teaspoons salt-free seasoning blend (like Frontier or Mrs. Dash)<br>1 tablespoon nutritional yeast, optional<br>Freshly ground pepper to taste<br>Salt (taste first, you may not need any if using canned beans) to taste
            </p>

            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Preheat the oven to 375°F.<br><br>Combine all the ingredients except the salt in a food processor and pulse on and off until the mixture starts holding together.<br><br>Stop the machine from time to time to stir the mixture around so that it gets chopped up evenly.<br><br>You want it to get fairly smooth, but with some texture — not totally pureed. Taste first to see if you’d like more salt. Err on the side of caution, as your marinara sauce will add salt to the dish as well.<br><br>Line a baking sheet with parchment. Form the bean mixture into 1&quot; balls and arrange on the baking sheet. Bake for 15 minutes or until lightly browned on the bottom, then carefully turn over (using a tablespoon works) and bake for about 10 minutes more, or until the underside is lightly browned as well.<br><br>Serve at once over the pasta with marinara sauce that you’ve presumably prepared while these were baking.
