            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1 C long grain brown rice (I use Lundberg&#x27;s)<br>1 C millet<br>3 handfuls of whole barley<br>3 handfuls of whole oats (groats)<br>1 handful of red rice, wild rice, or a mixture of wild type rices<br>2 tsp salt
            </p>
        </div>

                *If you can&#x27;t find one of the ingredients, don&#x27;t be discouraged. Simply substitute more of whatever you do have - more rice, millet, etc. I made a few minor tweaks to K.J.&#x27;s recipe, mainly a bit of salt during the cooking process, along with a few little word adjustments for clarity.<br><br>Mix all grains together, rinse, drain, and put in a large thick-bottomed pot. Stir in the salt. Cover with water up to your knuckle - about two inches above the grains. Bring to a boil, then turn down flame as low as it will go. Cook uncovered (simmering) until all water is gone, about thirty-five minutes. If you overshot the amount of water you added and your grains cook before the water absorbs entirely, strain off the extra water.<br><br>This makes a big pot of mixed grains. Plenty for a family of four to use over the course of a week.
