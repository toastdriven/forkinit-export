            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Cut the tofu into eight 1/2&quot; thick slices and place in a wide, shallow mixing bowl. Whisk together marinade ingredients and pour over tofu. Turn slices over so all sides are well coated. Cover bowl and place in refrigerator. Let marinate several hours or overnight, turning slices over occasionally, or spooning the marinade over them from time to time.<br><br>When ready to cook, preheat oven to 400 degrees. Mist a baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray, or line with parchment paper, and set aside. Combine ingredients for coating mix in a shallow bowl. Remove each slice of tofu from marinade one at a time and dredge in coating mix, covering it well all over. <br><br>Place on prepared baking sheet as soon as it is coated. Mist the tops lightly with olive oil or nonstick cooking spray [*note when I did this the force of the spray blew off a lot of the coating mix so be careful! Best not to use any oil anyway]<br><br>Bake until the bottoms are golden brown, about 15 minutes. Turn over slices and bake until the other side is golden brown, about 15 minutes longer.<br><br>Tip: Save leftover marinade and thicken with a small amount of flour, arrowroot, or cornstarch to make a delicious gravy.
