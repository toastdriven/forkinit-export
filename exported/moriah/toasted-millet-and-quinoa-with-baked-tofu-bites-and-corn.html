            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. Prepare the 1/2 recipe of Baked Tofu Bites.  Set the tofu aside while preparing the millet and quinoa.<br>2. Toast the millet and quinoa.<br>3. Preheat oven for the tofu bites.<br>4. Bring water and salt to a boil and add the millet and quinoa.  Cover and cook about 20 minutes.<br>5. After covering the grains, the oven should be ready for the tofu.  Bake the tofu for 15 minutes.<br>6. Put approximately 1/4 C of corn in the bottom of three to four bowls.  Heat so it&#x27;s warm.<br>7. When the tofu and grains are done cooking, fill each bowl with 1-1/2 C grains and one third (one quarter if making four servings) of the tofu bites.<br>8. Pour 2-3 T oil in each bowl and mix to incorporate.  Use whatever flavor oil suits your tastes, though sesame is a very good choice in this as it complements the tofu bites very well.  Enjoy!
