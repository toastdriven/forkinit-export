            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Preheat oven to 300 degrees. Oil and flour a bundt pan, set aside. In a small bowl, combine the egg replacer and water, mix until frothy, set aside. In another small bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt. In a medium-sized bowl, cream the Earth Balance and 1 3/4 cups of the sugar. Add the equivalent of 1/6 of the egg replacer-water mixture at a time to the creamed Earth Balance and sugar, mixing well after each &quot;1/6&quot; addition. Add the flour mixture alternating with the soymilk--start and end with the flour. Mix, or stir well after each addition of the soymilk (before you add the next bit of flour). Once the flour and soymilk have been mixed, add the lemon zest, lemon extract, and 2 tablespoons of the lemon juice. Stir well. Pour batter into prepared pan and bake for 1 1/2 hours, or until toothpick comes out clean.<br><br>Remove from oven, let sit in pan for 10 minutes, then invert onto cooling rack with a plate or pan underneath (because you&#x27;ll be pouring hot liquid over the cake, and you probably don&#x27;t want a sticky mess on your counter). Poke holes with toothpick all over the top of the cake and let cool for a while longer.<br><br>Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, boil the 1/2 cup lemon juice and remaining sugar over medium heat, and stir until sugar dissolves. Pour this &quot;syrup&quot; over the cake. Ok, it&#x27;s done. This cake will stay yummy, covered, for 5 days, (I&#x27;m almost certain it won&#x27;t last that long) or thereabouts. I think you&#x27;ll love this cake too. Enjoy, and thanks for choosing Vegan--it&#x27;s better for you and our precious planet!
