                1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour<br>1/3 cup sugar<br>1/2 teaspoon baking soda<br>1/2 teaspoon cinnamon<br>scant 1/2 teaspoon salt<br>1/4 cup oil<br>2 tablespoons molasses<br>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br>1/4 cup rice milk (plus maybe an extra tablespoon or so), soy milk or water will work, too

            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Preheat oven to 350 F. Line a light colored baking sheet with parchment paper.<br><br>In a large bowl mix together flour, sugar, baking soda, cinnamon and salt. Make a well in the middle and pour in oil, molasses and vanilla. Give the liquid ingredients a quick wisk with a fork and then continue mixing until everything is well combined and crumbly.<br><br>Drizzle in the milk and combine. Use your hands to knead the dough a few times until it holds together, add an extra tablespoon of rice milk if needed. You should be able to form a pliable ball of dough.<br><br>Line a work surface with parchment. Place the dough on the parchment and work into a rectangle. Flatten a bit with the palms of your hand and sprinkle with flour. Use a rolling pin to roll into a rectangle that is roughly 10 x 14 inches. The dough should be about 1/8 inch thick. If the edges look crumbly, that’s okay.<br><br>Cut the edges off so that you have a relatively even 12 x 8 rectangle. Cut the dough into 8 crackers, to do this evenly use a sharp paring knife to slice the dough in half lengthwise and widthwise. Then cut widthwise again on either side of the center widthwise cut. That probably made it sound confusing, read it slowly.<br><br>Use a very thin flexible spatula to transfer the crackers to a baking sheet. It helps if you spray the spatula with cooking spray so that it slips on and off easily.<br><br>Gather up the scraps of dough and form them into a ball, then roll it out into a 4 by 8 rectangle, or whatever size you can manage. I was able to get 4 more crackers out of the deal, but your mileage may vary. Cut the edges evenly and slice into 4 crackers then transfer to the baking sheet.<br><br>Score each cookie with a fork 4 times in 2 columns. You don’t need to poke all the way through. Bake for 12 to 14 minutes. 14 will give you nice crispy crackers, 12 minutes will be better for making ice cream sammiches.<br><br>Let cool completely on the baking sheet.
