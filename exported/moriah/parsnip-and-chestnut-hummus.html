Transfer to food processor and puree along with reserved cooking liquid, garlic, lemon juice, butter, olive oil and cumin until smooth and creamy, about 3 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.  Transfer to bowl and cool to room temperature.  Before serving, drizzle with tahini and garnish with parsley.
