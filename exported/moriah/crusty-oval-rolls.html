            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. In large bowl, combine yeast and warm water; stir to dissolve yeast.  Stir in agave, shortening, salt and 2 1/2 C flour; beat until very elastic.  Stir in enough of the remaining flour to make dough easy to handle.<br>2. Turn dough out onto floured surface.  Knead 15 minutes or until dough is smooth and elastic, adding as much remaining flour as needed to prevent sticking.  Shape dough into ball.  Place in large, greased bowl; turn dough once to grease surface.  Cover with towel; let rise in warm place (85Ã‚Â°F) until doubled, about 1 hour.<br>3. Punch dough down; knead briefly on floured surface.  Cover; let rest 10 minutes.  Divide dough into 10 equal pieces; shape each piece into ball.  Starting at center and working toward opposite ends, roll each ball on floured surface with palms of hands into tapered oval.  Place, evenly spaced, on 2 greased baking sheets.  Cover; let rise in warm place until almost doubled, about 25 minutes.<br>4. In small saucepan, combine cold water and cornstarch.  Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring constantly.  Boil until thickened and clear, about 2 minutes; cool slightly.  Brush risen rolls with warm cornstarch mixture.  Slash each roll lengthwise with sharp knife about 1/2&quot; deep and to about 1/2&quot; from each end.<br>5. Preheat oven to 375Ã‚Â°F.  Bake 30 to 35 minutes or until rolls are golden brown and sound hollow when tapped.  Remove to wire racks to cool.
