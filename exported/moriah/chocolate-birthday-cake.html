                1. Grease two 8&quot; round cake pans with vegan butter and line bottoms with parchment or wax paper.  Butter paper.<br>2. Make the batter as directed in the basic cake recipe and bake 25 to 30 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.  When cakes are completely cool, make frosting.<br>3. Place chips in a medium metal bowl.  Bring coconut milk or vegan cream just to a boil in a medium saucepan over medium heat.  Pour over chips and add vegan butter and salt.  Whisk until chips are melted and frosting is smooth and spreadable.  Cool until barely warm before frosting the cake.<br>4. Place one cake layer on a plate or cake stand.  Spread with about 3/4 C frosting.  Top with the second layer.  Spread the remaining frosting over the top and the sides.<br><br>Note:  If the frosting cools completely and thickens, place it in the metal bowl, over a pan of barely simmering water and whisk contents until smooth.<br><br>Makes an 8&quot; round layer cake
