            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                For the Crust: <br>1. In a bowl, combine the flour and the salt. Mix the water with 1/3 C of the flour mixture to make a paste. Set aside.<br>2. With a pastry cutter or a fork, cut the vegetable shortening into the remaining flour mixture until the texture is Ã¢â‚¬Å“pebbly.Ã¢â‚¬Â Add the paste and mix well. Shape into a ball and divide into 2 parts.<br>3. Lightly flour a clean countertop and rolling pin. Roll 1 portion of the dough at a time. Roll from the center out, lifting the roller at the end of the dough (rather than rolling back and forth). Roll to a 1/8&quot; thickness. <br>4. Have an 8&quot; or 9&quot; pie pan ready. The rolled dough should be at least 2 inches larger than your pie pan. Loosen from the rolling surface, fold in half, and place in the center of the pie pan. Unfold and gently work into the pan, pressing lightly. Trim any excess dough with a knife. <br><br>For the Filling: <br>1. Preheat the oven to 400Ã‚Â°F. <br>2. In a large bowl, combine the apples, sugar, lemon juice, vanilla extract, and cinnamon. Let stand for approximately 15 minutes, or until juices form. Add the flour and mix.<br><br>To Assemble:<br>1. Spoon the filling into the bottom crust and dot with margarine. <br>2. Roll out the second ball of dough to form a 13&quot; round circle. Drape over the filling. <br>3. Seal the top and bottom crust edges together and trim any excess dough, leaving a 1/2&quot; overhang. Fold under and crimp decoratively with a greased fork. <br>4. Brush the pie with the soy milk. Combine the sugar and the cinnamon in a small bowl and sprinkle over the pie. <br>5. Transfer to a baking sheet and place in the oven. <br>6. Immediately reduce the temperature to 375Ã‚Â°F. Bake for approximately 2 hours, or until the crust is golden brown, the apples are tender, and the filling is thick and bubbling. If the edges are browning too quickly, cover with foil. <br>7. Serve warm or at room temperature. <br>Makes 8 servings
