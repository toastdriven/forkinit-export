                1. In a large heavy skillet, roast the corn over medium high heat until golden, remove and set aside. Heat 1 T of oil in skillet over medium heat and cook eggplant with a pinch of salt until golden, about 10 minutes. Set aside.<br>2. In a large saucepan, heat remaining 1 T of oil over medium high heat. Add the garlic and sautÃ© for 1 minute, then add the onion and cook until onion is translucent, about 7 minutes.<br>3. Reduce heat to medium. Add the protein crumbles, jalapeÃ±o, cumin, cinnamon, coriander, paprika, chili powder, salt and pepper and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add some juice from the tomatoes if mixture cooks too quickly. Reduce the heat to medium-low and stir in corn, eggplant, beans, tomatoes, broth, and lime juice. Cover and cook for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Taste to adjust seasonings, then stir in chocolate.<br>Serves 4-6
