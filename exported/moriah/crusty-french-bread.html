            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. In a mixing bowl, mix 2 C of the flour and yeast.  Add warm water and salt.  Beat with electric mixer on low speed for 30 seconds, scraping bowl constantly.  Then beat on high speed for 3 minutes.  Stir in as much remaining flour as you can.<br>2. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface.  Knead in enough of the remaining flour to make a stiff dough that is smooth and elastic (8 to 10 minutes total).  Shape into a ball.  Spray a large bowl with nonstick cooking spray.  Place dough in bowl, turning once to coat surface.  Cover; let rise in warm place until doubled in size (about 1 hour).<br>3. Punch dough down.  Turn onto lightly floured surface.  Divide in half.  Cover; let rest 10 minutes.  Spray 2 baking sheets with nonstick cooking spray; sprinkle with cornmeal.  On a lightly floured surface, roll each half into a 15x2&quot; rectangle.  Tightly roll up, jelly-roll style, starting from one of the long sides.  Seal with your fingertips as you roll; taper ends.<br>4. Place seam sides down on prepared baking sheets.  Cover; let rise until nearly doubled in size (about 35 minutes).  With a sharp knife, make 3 or 4 diagonal cuts about 1/4&quot; deep across the tops.  Fill a spritzer bottle with water; spray loaves lightly.<br>5. Bake in 400Ã‚Â°F oven for 5 minutes.  Spray loves again with water; bake 5 minutes more.  Spray loaves with water a third time.  Bake for 20 to 25 minutes more or until loaves sound hollow when you tap the tops with your fingers.  Remove from baking sheets.  Cool on wire racks.  Makes 2 loaves.<br><br>Hard Rolls:  Prepare as directed above, except shape dough as follows.  Cut each half of dough into eighths, making 16 pieces total.  Shape each piece into a roll; place rolls 2&quot; apart on prepared baking sheets.  Cover and let rise until nearly doubled in size (about 45 minutes).  Cut a shallow crisscross in tops.  Bake as directed for loaves; except reduce final baking time to 15 to 20 minutes.
