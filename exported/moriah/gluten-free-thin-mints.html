            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Cookies:<br>In a medium bowl, cream together butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in egg, vanilla and peppermint extracts, followed by the cocoa powder. Blend thoroughly. Add in gluten free flour and salt and mix until mixture comes together in a soft dough and no streaks of flour remain visible.<br>On a large piece of parchment or wax paper, shape dough a log about 1 1/2 inches (or about 4 cm) in diameter. Roll up tightly and freeze for at least 1-2 hours.<br>Preheat oven to 375F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.<br>Remove dough from freezer. Dough may be very firm, and if so, allow it to sit for a few minutes before slicing.<br>Slice dough into rounds not more than 1/4 inch thick – if they are too thick, they will not be as crisp – and place on a parchment lined baking sheet. Cookies will not spread very much, so you can put them quite close together.<br>Bake for about 12-13 minutes, until cookies are firm at the edges. Allow to cool on baking sheet for 2-3 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack. Cookies will firm up more as they cool.<br>Cool cookies completely before dipping in chocolate.<br><br>Coating:<br>In a microwave safe bowl, combine chocolate and butter. Melt on high power in the microwave, stirring every 45-60 seconds, until chocolate is very smooth. Stir in extracts. Chocolate should have a consistency similar to thick chocolate syrup.<br>Dip each cookie in melted chocolate, turn with a fork to coat, then transfer to a piece of parchment paper or wax paper to set up for at least 60 minutes, or until chocolate is cool and firm.<br>Reheat chocolate as needed to keep it smooth and easy to dip into.<br>Cookies can be stored at room temperature (unwrapped) if they will be eaten within a couple of days, otherwise they should be kept in the freezer for long term storage.
