            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. Heat a heavy 9&quot; or 10&quot; oven-proof skillet over medium heat.  Add onions and oil, stir, reduce heat and cover with a lid that fits directly over the onions.  Sweat onions until soft.  Add garlic, potatoes, carrots, rutabagas, collard greens or kale, and rosemary.  Stir, cover and cook for about 5 minutes.  Combine water, arrowroot and Bragg Liquid Amino to vegetables with edamame and pepper and continue to cook while you make the cake.  Allow about 10 minutes.<br>2. Preheat the oven to 350Ã‚Â°F.  <br>3. To make the cake, combine soymilk and lemon juice and set aside.  In a medium mixing bowl, combine flours, baking soda and baking powder.  Mix well with a pastry blender, and cut in shortening or margarine until the mix resembles fine granules.  Blend the sweet potatoes with the soymilk until well blended.  A hand blender works well for this, but you can use a blender instead.  Stir wet and dry ingredients together until a fairly firm dough is formed, but do not overmix, as this will make the crust tough.  Add a bit more flour if necessary.  On a floured board, pat or roll dough out to the size of the skillet.<br>4. Remove the vegetables from heat.  Place dough over vegetables and make about 5 slits on the cake top, radiating out from the center.  For a richer tasting cake, spread 1 T margarine over the top and sprinkle paprika over the top.  This gives a browner apprearance to the cake.  Bake 25 minutes or until top is brown and vegetables are bubbling.  Let cool slightly before serving.
