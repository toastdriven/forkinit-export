                2 T coconut flour<br>1/2 tsp baking powder<br>Pinch of salt<br>2 T cocoa powder<br>Egg Replacer equal to 1 egg<br>1/2 tsp vanilla extract<br>4 T almond milk/milk of choice<br>1 T coconut oil, melted<br>6 drops of liquid stevia (you can substitute honey, sugar, other sugar substitute)

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Combine coconut flour, baking powder, salt, cocoa powder in bowl and mix.<br>Combine &quot;egg,&quot; liquid of choice, vanilla extract, coconut oil, stevia in another bowl and mix. (You can really just pour everything into one big bowl and mix but I prefer to do it in stages.)<br>Pour wet into dry and mix until lumps are pretty much gone.<br>Put in a microwavable safe mug and cook for approximately 1 1/2 minutes on high. (Time may vary depending on the strength of your microwave.)<br>Consume.<br><br>Note: Coconut oil may harden with the wet ingredients; it will melt once it goes into the microwave again. As for a topping, we went the non-traditional Paleo route and melted some chocolate chips on top for a faux ganache.
