            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Heat a medium pot over medium heat with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. When hot enough, add the seitan and saute until golden on all sides about 4-5 minutes. Toward the end, add the liquid smoke and smoked salt. Remove from pot and set aside.<br><br>Now add about 2-3 tablespoons of olive oil to the pot. Add the onions and saute for a good 8 minutes until they are translucent and tender. If your pot has burned pieces from the seitan, deglaze it with a bit of vegetable broth. Add the garlic and saute for a minute until fragrant. Now it’s time to add the green beans and potatoes. Saute the green beans and potatoes for about 5 minutes.<br><br>Now add the tomato, paprika, oregano, chili flakes and season with salt and pepper. Saute for another two minutes. Add the vegetable broth or water and bring to a boil and then to a simmer. After a couple of minutes add the seitan that you have set aside. Simmer the stew for about 45-50 minutes until the green beans and potatoes are tender. If the stew starts to get dry simply add some more broth. Re-season with salt and pepper to taste, if necessary. Remember to not go heavy on the salt because the smokey seitan is salty already from the smoked salt. Let the stew sit for 15 minutes or you can eat it as soon as it is finished cooking. <br><br>I like to serve these stewed green beans with some rice, bread, and a side salad or vegetable.
