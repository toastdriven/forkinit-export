            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. In a small saucepan, combine the water and agar-agar flakes, and simmer for 5 minutes to thoroughly dissolve the agar-agar flakes. <br>2. In a blender, process the coconut milk and vegetable oil until well blended. <br>3. Add the dissolved agar-agar, non-dairy milk, sugar, vanilla and salt, and process for 1-2 minutes or until very smooth and creamy. <br>4. Taste and add additional sweetener or vanilla, if desired. <br>5. Add the strawberries and pulse the blender only enough times to leave small chunks of strawberry.  (If blender is not large enough to hold all the ingredients together, pour half the creamy liquid from step 4 into the ice cream maker bowl, process the strawberries in the remaining liquid, and mix thoroughly together with the first half in the bowl, using a rubber spatula.) <br>6. If using an ice cream maker, freeze according to the manufacturer&#x27;s instructions. <br>7. If you don&#x27;t have an ice cream maker, pour the mixture into a large shallow pan and place it in the freezer. Stir the mixture every hour or so to give it a smooth texture. When completely frozen, remove it from the freezer and allow it to sit at room temperature.
