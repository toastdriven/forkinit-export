            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. Put rice and water in a medium to large pot.  Put lid on, but leave it cracked to let some steam escape.  Bring to a boil and reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for approximately 30 minutes.  (The starch in the rice will cause the water to boil over the edges of the pot.  I usually lift the lid until the bubbles go down a few times during simmering to let all the steam escape, then I replace the lid cracked open as before.)<br>2. As soon as the water is level with the top of the rice, turn on the burner for the wok to medium-high heat.  The rice will be done shortly.  At this time, if your wok is too small to accommodate all the ingredients listed, do two separate batches.  (I always do two batches.)  <br>3. When wok is ready, add half the liquid from the bamboo shoots and water chestnuts, along with a small amount of sesame oil.  Let some of the liquid evaporate before adding half the can of bamboo shoots, half the water chestnuts, 1/2 C peas and half the tofu.  Reserve the rest of the liquid from the bamboo and water chestnuts for the next batch.  Let this simmer as you tend to the rice.  <br>4. While there is still a little water left in the rice, remove lid and stir.  Turn off heat and cover tightly with the lid.  This will prevent the rice from drying out before you&#x27;re ready for it.<br>5. Add soy sauce to the wok, to taste, and stir the veggies and tofu until they are cooked through.  If there is still a lot of liquid, let most of it evaporate before adding the rice.<br>6. Add half the rice to the wok and quickly cover the remaining rice in the pot with the lid again.  Add in sesame seeds and stir the ingredients in the wok until there is little to no liquid left.  Dish onto a plate and sprinkle with granulated garlic and Oriental seasoning.<br>7. Repeat steps 3, 5 and 6 for the second batch.<br>Serves 4.
