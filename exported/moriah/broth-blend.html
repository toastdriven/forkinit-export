                1. Pulverize in a food processor (to avoid getting a mouthful of those rosemary spikes).  Store the powdered broth in the fridge, as nutritional yeast keeps best there.  If you can&#x27;t find flake-type yeast, but only the powdered &quot;good tasting&quot; yeast (not brewer&#x27;s yeast or baking yeast), use half as much.  This recipe doubles (and even triples) easily, and will keep indefinitely.<br><br>Use as a seasoning, as a gravy base, for soup or stock, or add to the cooking water of rice, veggies or potatoes.  I prefer to keep the salt in the mixture low, so that I can use it in a recipe that calls for tamari or miso without having to worry about overall saltiness.<br><br>To make a broth, mix 1/2 to 1 T with 1 C boiling water (adjust the salt to your taste).  For a beefy broth, mix 2 tsp of the mixture with 1 1/2 tsp dark miso and 1 C boiling water.
