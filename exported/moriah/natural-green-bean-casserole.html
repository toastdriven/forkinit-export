            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. Preheat oven to 425Â°F.<br>2. In a large bowl, combine whole wheat flour, white flour, garlic granules, sea salt, pepper, and cayenne. Add onions and stir well or use clean hands to coat. Pour buttermilk over onions and toss again to coat well. Place breadcrumbs in a separate large bowl. Add olive oil and mix well using clean fingers. Add onions. Toss well, again, coating every onion. Coat a large cookie sheet with olive oil spray. Transfer onions to prepared cookie sheet. Bake onions for half an hour, or until golden brown and crispy. While onions are baking, steam green beans until just tender, about 4 to 5 minutes. If necessary, drain green beans and return to pan.<br>3. Reduce oven to 350Â°F.<br>4. Pour mushroom soup into the steamed green beans. Add half the onion rings. Place in an olive oil-sprayed casserole dish. Top with remaining onion rings. Bake for 30 minutes or until hot and bubbly.<br><br>Nutrition Info<br>Per Serving (5.5 oz-wt.): 140 calories (50 from fat), 6g total fat, 1g saturated fat, 4g dietary fiber, 4g protein, 19g carbohydrate, 5mg cholesterol, 65mg sodium
