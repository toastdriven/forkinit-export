            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                STOVE TOP: Add apple slices, cider (or apple juice concentrate), lemon juice, and pumpkin pie spice to large pan. Bring liquid in bottom of pan to a boil  over medium high heat, lower heat to medium, cover and cook for 45-60 minutes, stirring every 15 minutes, until apples and skin are soft.<br><br>SLOW COOKER: Add ingredients, cover, and cook 3 hours on high or 5 hours on low, until apples and skin are soft. (Note: Slow cookers can vary; cooking times are approximate.)<br><br>BLEND IT: Use an immersion blender (or blender or food processor) to blend the cooked apples into a sauce consistency with whatever texture you prefer--smooth or chunky. (The skin should blend in easily; if not, return to stove or slow cooker and continue cooking until softened enough to blend.)<br><br>STORE IT: Refrigerate for up to 1 week or freeze for up to 1 year. Use water process canning to store it at room temperature for up to 1 year.<br><br>FOR WATER PROCESS CANNING: Add hot applesauce to hot sterilized jars leaving 1/2&quot; of headspace, and water process in water canner 15 minutes for pints &amp; half pints, 20 minutes for quarts. Turn off heat, and leave jars in hot water for 5 minutes. Remove from canner and let rest undisturbed for 12-24 hours. Store jars in dark, cool place for up to 1 year.<br><br>For canning safety:<br>--Follow jar preparation and processing recommended by the USDA; see canning safety guidelines at http://www.freshpreserving.com<br><br>For general canning tips, go to www.theyummylife.com/canning_tips
