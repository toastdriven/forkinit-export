            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.<br>Mix together the almond milk and apple cider vinegar. Set aside.<br>Sift together the flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, baking soda and chai mixture into a large bowl. Don’t skip this step as it sifts out the large sugar crystals and wheat flakes.<br>Add the applesauce and vanilla to the almond milk mixture and stir well.<br>Add the wet almond milk and applesauce mixture to the sifted dry mixture and stir to combine. Do not over mix.<br>Put the batter into either a piping bag or a plastic bag with the corner cut off to pipe it into your donut pan. Fill the pan to about 3/4 full in each donut.<br>Bake for 10-13 minutes You can test by inserting a toothpick and pulling it out. If it is clean then they are done. If not, bake them for just a minute or two longer and test again.<br>Let them cool in the pan for about 5 minutes and then flip the pan to release them. Let them cool for 5-10 minutes longer.<br>Mix the powdered sugar, vanilla bean, and almond milk. Add more almond milk 1/2 tsp at a time if you want to thin it out. You want it pretty thick or it will not stick to the donut.<br>Once the donuts have cooled slightly you can liberally spoon the glaze over the donuts.<br>Store in an airtight container in the fridge… if they make it that long you eat them all.
