            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Place lentils in a medium saucepan and soak overnight (while lentils do not require soaking, doing so aids in their digestion). Drain and rinse lentils. Add water and bay leaf and bring to a boil. Lower heat and simmer, partially covered, about 30 minutes or until lentils are soft and the liquid is gone. Transfer to a medium-sized bowl, add vinegar, cooked potatoes, and ground pumpkin seeds; mash well and set aside.<br><br>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onions and leeks and saut√© for 5 minutes or until translucent. Add garlic, carrots, kale, parsley, thyme, salt, and pepper. Turn down heat to medium-low. Cover and cook about 10 to 15 minutes until all the vegetables are tender.<br><br>Add the saute to the lentils and mix well. Chill for an hour before shaping patties.<br><br>Form burgers into 4-inch rounds. Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat and cook on both sides until burgers are heated through and form a crisp exterior. Add a few slices of gruyere, camembert, harvarti, or chevre cheese on top. Cover and cook until cheese melts.<br><br>Optional: serve with a side of parsley walnut pesto or fresh tomato slices sprinkled with diced chives, sea salt, and black pepper.
