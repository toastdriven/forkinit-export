            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1-2 Tbsp nutritional yeast (add more for a more intense “cheese” flavor)<br>1/2 tsp garlic powder<br>1 tsp sea salt (reduce to 3/4 tsp if desired as they’re pretty cheesy/savory)<br>1/2 cup + 2 T unbleached all purpose flour or whole wheat pastry flour<br>1/4 cup oat flour (or just sub more all purpose)<br>3 Tbsp yellow corn meal<br>OPTIONAL: 1/4 tsp baking powder for fluffiness<br>3 Tbsp olive oil or vegan butter (such as Earth Balance | I did a 1/2-1/2 mix of both)<br>2-4 Tbsp cold water
            </p>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Preheat oven to 350°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.<br>Add dry ingredients to a food processor and process to thoroughly combine.<br>Then add olive and/or butter and pulse again until crumbly.<br>Add cold water 1 T at a time until it forms a loose dough. You don’t want too much water, so go easy on it and add a little at a time. It shouldn’t need more than 3 T.<br>Remove from processor and form into a loose ball with your hands. It’s actually good for this dough to be worked and warmed by the heat of your hands, so don’t worry about touching it too much. However, you are not kneading it, just forming it into a disc.<br>Lay on a lightly floured surface – I found parchment worked great as my flat surface – dust the top with flour, and roll to 1/8&quot; thick with a lightly floured rolling pin. Use a knife, pizza cutter or small cut cookie cutter shape to cut the dough into square crackers. Optional: dot the centers with a fork prong or chopstick for more character/resemblance to a Cheez-It.<br>Bake at 350°F for 12-17 minutes or until puffy and golden brown. These are pretty tender. For a crispier cracker, bake until golden brown. Makes about 70 crackers.
