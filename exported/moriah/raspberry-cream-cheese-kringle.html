                1. Put the flour, butter, sugar and salt into a bowl.  Using a pastry blender, two knives, or your hands, blend together until the mixture is crumbly.  If you don&#x27;t mind a little mess, your hands work much better.  In a separate bowl, mix the dry yeast, egg replacer and milk.  Don&#x27;t worry that the yeast remains cold; that&#x27;s the beauty of this recipe, no rising!  Add milk mixture to dry ingredients.  Mix well with a fork until all ingredients are blended; it will pull away from the sides and form a ball.  You may have to work the final flour into the dough with your hands.  Divide it into two pieces, flatten into discs, wrap in plastic wrap and put them into the refrigerator overnight.<br>2. Preheat the oven to 350Â°F.  Beat together the cream cheese, sugar and Vanilla.  Roll out each piece of dough into a rectangle, 1/8&quot; thick, about the length of your cookie sheet and as wide as 1/8&quot; will allow.  Spread half of the cream cheese filling over each piece of dough.  Then, spread each kringle with half of the Raspberry Enlightenment and sprinkle with half of the pecans.  Rolling from the short ends, roll each side to the center.  Pinch the center together and roll the ends under.  Place each kringle on an ungreased cookie sheet.  Bake 20-25 minutes, changing racks halfway through the baking time (top to bottom, bottom to top).  Remove kringles from the cookie sheets to a cooling rack and let cool about 10 minutes before glazing.<br>3. Mix glaze ingredients together and whisk until smooth.  Top the kringles with the glaze.  Tastes great warm, so slice and serve right after glazing if desired.
