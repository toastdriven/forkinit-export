            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. Bring water to a boil. <br>2. Place millet and vegetables in water. Add sea salt. Bring back to a boil. <br>3. Reduce heat to low, cover, place a flame tamer under pot, and then simmer for 35 minutes or until water is absorbed. (If you are making porridge, the millet should be creamy).<br><br>Variations<br><br>- For helping to rebalance the pancreas and stabilize blood sugar, use any combination of sweet vegetables including winter squash, onion, cabbage, and carrots.<br><br>- Use 1 head of cauliflower or corn in place of squash.<br><br>Leftover Ideas<br>- Press leftovers into a loaf pan and refrigerate. Cut loaf into slices and fry in sesame or olive oil. Serve alone, with a shiitake or grain gravy, or on a sandwich with your favorite toppings.<br><br>- Form into croquettes/patties with a small amount of whole wheat pastry flour. Refrigerate. Pan fry in sesame or olive oil, or bake until crisp. Serve alone, with a shiitake or grain gravy, or on a sandwich with your favorite toppings.<br><br>- Add 2-3 cups more water, 1-2 cups fresh vegetables, and a bay leaf or other seasoning to make a soup with the leftover grain. Optionally puree for a creamier soup.
