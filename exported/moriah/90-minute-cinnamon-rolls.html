            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. Set aside 1 C all purpose flour from total amount. Mix remaining flour, yeast, sugar, and salt in large bowl.<br>2. Heat milk, water, and 1/4 C margarine until hot to the touch, 125F-130F. Stir hot liquid into dry ingredients. Mix in egg (or Egg Replacer). Mix in enough reserved flour to make a soft dough, so that it does not stick to the bowl. Turn out onto floured board and knead 5 minutes. Cover dough and let rest 10 minutes.<br>3. Mix brown sugar, cinnamon, and margarine together. Roll dough into 12x9&quot; rectangle. Spread with cinnamon mixture. Sprinkle with raisins if using. Roll from long side, jelly-roll style; pinch to seal the seam.<br>4. Cut into 12 equal slices with a sharp knife. Place cut side up into large greased muffin cups; place on baking sheet over a shallow pan half-filled with boiling water. Cover dough and let rise 20 minutes.<br>5. Bake at 375 F for 20 minutes or until browned. Remove from muffin cups to cool. Serve warm.
