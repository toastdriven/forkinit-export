            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                In a medium bowl, pour boiling water over the wild rice.  Allow the rice to soak for one hour, then drain.  Place the drained rice and the stock in a large saucepan and bring to a simmer.  Simmer until the rice is just tender - about 30 to 40 minutes.  Strain, reserving the stock and rice separately.  Measure the stock - add water if necessary to make 6 cups.<br><br>While the rice is cooking, sweat the celery, carrot and onion in 2 T of butter until tender.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Set aside.<br><br>To finish the soup, heat the reserved stock to a simmer.  In a large saucepan, melt the remaining butter over medium heat.  When the foam subsides, which in the flour.  Cook, whisking constantly, for a few minutes - the roux will be bubbly and cream-colored.  Remove from the heat and pour in half of the hot stock, whisking constantly until smooth - it will thicken immediately.  Add the remaining stock.  Return to the heat and stir constantly until the soup base returns to a simmer; stir in the reserved wild rice, vegetables and seitan or tofu, if using.  Simmer for a few minutes to allow the flavors to blend.  To serve, add the cream and the sherry and heat through.  Taste and correct the seasoning.  Serve in warmed soup bowls, garnished with toasted almonds and sliced scallions.<br>
