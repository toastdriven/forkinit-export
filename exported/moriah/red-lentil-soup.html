            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. In medium saucepan, combine lentils, bay leaf and 4 C cold water.  Cover partially and bring to a boil over high heat. Mix well, reduce heat to low and simmer until lentils are tender, about 12 minutes.<br><br>2. Remove bay leaf and stir in 1/2 tsp salt. PurÃƒÂ©e lentil mixture with an immersion blender or in a blender until smooth. Set aside. (This step is optional--I don&#x27;t really like to puree my soups. I just leave the lentils whole)<br><br>3. While lentils are cooking, heat a large pot over medium-low heat with some broth/water to sautÃƒÂ©. Add onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 8 minutes. Add garlic, ginger, cumin and coriander and cook, stirring, 3 minutes. Stir in parsnips, carrots, salt to taste and 1 1/2 C water. Increase heat to high and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer, uncovered, until vegetables are tender, about 10 to 12 minutes.<br><br>4. Stir spinach and lemon juice into vegetable mixture. Cover and cook until spinach is just wilted, about 2 minutes. Stir in reserved lentil purÃƒÂ©e and cayenne and warm through. Taste and season with salt and cayenne. Serve hot.<br><br>For a lively variation, stir in a tiny dollop of chili paste or hot pepper sauce and/or sprinkle each portion with a handful of chopped fresh cilantro or flat-leaf parsley. Note: They say to puree the lentils, but I never do and think it works great! I like my soups chunky, but it is up to you!
