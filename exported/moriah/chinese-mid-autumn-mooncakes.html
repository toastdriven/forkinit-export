            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Outer Mooncake Layer:<br>In a food processor, fitted with the “S” blade, combine together the almond flour, maple syrup (or desired liquid sweetener), and the extract or essential oil. Process until it starts to form small balls.<br>I used the orange essential oil.<br>For this dough to turn out you need to use a very fine almond flour, not meal (not ground whole almonds). This not only gives the dough a finer finish, it also helps to make it moldable. You can make raw almond flour yourself. It does take a few steps but it is worth it in the end. I recommend using pure white almond pulp that has been dehydrated and ground to a flour.<br>Divide the dough into 9 balls. By weight, 40 g or 2 T worth. I recommend using a scale as it is much quicker and accurate than measuring each one out with measuring spoons.<br>Cover with plastic and set aside while you make the filling.<br><br>Fennel Fig Center:<br>Place the dried figs in a bowl with enough warm water to cover them. Allow them to soak until they soften (roughly 15 minutes).<br>In a food processor, combine the walnuts, figs, sesame seeds, vinegar, fennel seeds and salt. Process until it forms a paste.<br>Divide the batter into 10 balls. By weight, 50 g or 1/4 C worth. Again, a scale is really handy for this job. You will have one extra filling ball to eat while making the mooncakes. We all need nutrients to support our creative time in the kitchen. See, I was thinking of you!<br><br>Assembly:<br>Take the dough and roll out to roughly 4 1/2″ in circumference.<br>Do this in between two pieces of plastic wrap.<br>The plastic wrap will allow you to monitor the size you are rolling it out to.<br>Place a fig ball in the center and gently gather the edges around the base of the fig ball.<br>Don’t pinch the large folds together creating lumps of thick dough. Just gently bring all edges together, smoothing out the connecting lines.<br>Roll the ball between the palms of your hands. This will create a smooth surface and work out the “wrinkles.”<br>Option: You can roll the ball in raw cacao powder if you wish to create a different look. If you want to make some plain ones and some chocolate ones. Make the plain ones first before you dirty up the stamp with cacao.<br>I will say that the ones rolled in cacao powder release from the mooncake stamp really easy. The plain ones will stick a tad but nothing to make you pull out your hair.<br>Take the mooncake stamp and turn it upside down, place the ball inside and gently press it in with your fingers.<br>Turn it upside down and place it on the cutting board and press the plunger down.<br>Pull the plunger back, along with the base, causing the cake to come out of the bottom. Easier done than explained here.<br>My advice is to make sure that you are fully committed to pressing the stamp into the dough once you start. Don’t twist or jiggle it around, as this will blur the stamp pattern. If this happens, no harm done. Remove the dough and smooth it back out and roll it in your hands as instructed above.<br>That’s it! My instructions seem long. I just wanted to share every step with you since I can’t be there to help.<br>Enjoy and store the leftovers in the fridge for 1-2 weeks or in the freezer for 1-2 months.<br><br>Here is an example of a mooncake mold:<br>https://nouveauraw.com/equipment/pans-forms-molds/blogger-mid-autumn-festival-4-stamp-moon-cake-round-flower-mold-mould-decoration-pastry/
