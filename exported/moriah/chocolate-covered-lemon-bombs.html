            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Soak the cashews a few hours before starting the recipe. Once ready to use them be sure to drain and rinse them.<br>In the food processor, fitted with the “S” blade, combine the almond flour, shredded coconut, coconut flour and salt. Process until everything is well incorporated.<br>Add the cashews, agave, lemon juice, vanilla and zest. Tip: Zest the lemon before you juice it. Process until it becomes a thick and cream-like batter.<br>With a cookie scoop, scoop out the batter and level it off. Plop out onto the counter, roll into a ball shape and place in a baking pan. Slide into the fridge or freezer while you prepare the chocolate.<br>Once the chocolate is made, dip the lemon bombs into it, rolling them around, making sure they are completely coated. Lift out and tap the fork handle gently on the edge of the bowl to knock off the excess chocolate.<br>Place the lemon bombs on a piece of wax paper or teflex sheet. Sprinkle with shredded coconut and leave to harden.<br>Store in an air-tight container in the fridge or on the counter top for 5-7 days.<br><br>Hardening Chocolate:<br>Dehydrator method:<br>I have a 9-tray Excalibur dehydrator which allows me to remove the trays and place bowls in the cavity of it. It worked perfectly for this recipe.<br>Shred about 1 C raw cacao butter in a 2 C measuring cup.  You can use a bowl but this way once melted, you can double check your melted measurement (this just saves dishes). Place the measuring cup in the dehydrator. I also place a metal bowl in there to warm the surface of the bowl.<br>Once the butter is completely melted, pour the liquid into the metal bowl.  Whisk the cacao powder in, making sure to work out any lumps.<br>Add the agave while you continue to whisk, then the pinch of sea salt.<br>Proceed with making chocolates or covering your sweet treats.<br>Place the finished treat in the fridge to harden or leave at room temp (as long as the house temp isn’t above 70°F).<br><br>Double boiler method:<br>Set up the double boiler and add melt the cacao butter until it is completely melted.<br>Add the cacao powder, whisking during the process. Work out any lumps.<br>Add agave, stirring really well. Add the pinch of salt and stir.<br>Proceed with making chocolates or covering your sweet treats.<br>Place the finished treat in the fridge to harden or leave at room temp (as long as the house temp isn’t above 70°F).
