            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. Preheat oven to 425Â°F.<br>2. Heat oil in medium saucepan.  Combine onion, carrots, red potato, celery and garlic and cook for 3 to 5 minutes.  Add vegetable broth.  Bring to a boil, then turn down to a simmer.  Cook until vegetables are tender crisp.  Add peas at the end.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.<br>3. In a glass measuring cup, whisk water, cornstarch and soy sauce together until cornstarch is completely dissolved.  Stir into vegetable mixture and cook until sauce thickens, about 3 minutes.<br>4. Roll out dough and cut out two circles large enough to cover bottom of two individual pot pie dishes.  Fill pot pies with vegetable mixture.  Re-roll dough and cut out two more circles large enough to cover the top of each pot pie. Place dough on top of each pot pie and seal the edges.  Cut a slit in the top of each.  <br>5. Bake pot pies for 30 minutes, or until crust is brown.
