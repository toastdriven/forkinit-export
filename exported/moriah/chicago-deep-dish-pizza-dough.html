                1. Sprinkle the yeast over the water.  Stir until the yeast is dissolved.  Stir in the oil.<br>2. In a large bowl, combine 3 cups of the all-purpose flour, the whole wheat flour, and the salt.  Add the yeast mixture and stir until a soft dough forms.  Knead 10 minutes, adding more flour if necessary, or until the dough is smooth and elastic.<br>3. Lightly oil a large bowl.  Add the dough, turning it once to oil the top.  Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place about 1 hour, or until doubled in bulk.<br>4. Divide the dough in half.  Punch the dough down to eliminate air bubbles.  Shape and bake the pizzas.<br>I bake my deep dish pizza at 400 degrees F for 30 minutes.
