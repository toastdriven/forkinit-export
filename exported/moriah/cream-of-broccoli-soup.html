            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. Heat the oil in a large saucepan.  Add the onion and cook gently for about 5 minutes, stirring frequently, until almost clear.<br>2. Add the broccoli. Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, for about 10 minutes.  Add stock and oregano and bring to a boil, stirring.<br>3. Reduce heat and cover the pan, leaving a crack for steam to escape.  Simmer gently, stirring occasionally, for about 30 minutes.  If using vegan cheddar, add in during last few minutes and stir until melted.  <br>4. Process the soup in a blender or food processor until it reaches a desirable consistency.  <br>5. Pour back into saucepan.  Add the coconut milk and stir over low heat until hot but not boiling.  Adjust with more stock or coconut milk to desired consistency.  Season with more oregano, salt and pepper, if desired.  Enjoy!
