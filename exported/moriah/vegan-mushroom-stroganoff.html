            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. Saute the onion and garlic in a sprayed pan, or in your favorite saute liquid, until soft.  Add the mushrooms and continue sauteing until they soften.  Add lemon juice, balsamic vinegar, tarragon, paprika and thyme, and mix well.<br>2. Blend vegetable broth and tahini, pour into the pan and mix well. Remove from heat, and season with pepper to taste.  Stir in tomato and serve immediately, garnished with parsley.<br><br>Although the tahini is high in fat, if you saute with broth or wine, and then serve over rice (&#x27;Fantastic Foods&#x27; White Basmati is what I tested it with), this recipe comes in at about 20% calories from fat.  The flavor is absolutely essential to the dish.
