            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                The Night Before:<br>1. Soak the beans in plenty of water to cover, with a few inches of water above the beans.<br>Note: The beans can soak in water in the refrigerator for up to 1 week with no fermentation, if you aren&#x27;t sure when you&#x27;ll make the waffles.<br><br>In the Morning:<br>1. Drain the beans. Place in a blender along with all the other ingredients. Blend until smooth, light, and foamy.<br>2. Meanwhile, heat a nonstick waffle iron.* When hot, pour on a heaping 1/3 C of the batter for a 4-inch-square waffle. Close the iron and set the timer for 7 minutes. If the iron is hard to open when the time&#x27;s up, let the waffle cook for a couple more minutes. The waffle should be brown and crispy. Repeat until all the batter has been used. If the batter gets thicker while standing, add a little water, just until it&#x27;s the consistency you started out with.<br>3. Serve immediately, or let cool on cake racks. Serve with your favorite toppings. Leftovers can be place in the freezer in plastic bags or rigid containers.<br>4. If you don&#x27;t use all the batter and you don&#x27;t want to cook the waffles ahead of time and freeze them, just refrigerate the batter in the blender with the lid on. You can re-blend the batter (adding a tiny bit more water if the batter has become too thick) just before cooking.<br><br>*Note: Even if you have a nonstick iron, this recipe will work better if you spray the grids well with oil from a pump-sprayer.<br><br>Makes 8 waffles
