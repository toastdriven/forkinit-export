            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Cake:<br><br>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a large bowl, mix until smooth the Earth Balance, peanut butter, and maple syrup. Mix the egg replacer and water until frothy, and add to the peanut butter-syrup-Earth Balance mixture. Add the coconut and the oat &quot;meal&quot; and stir until everything is well mixed. If using, stir in the chocolate chips.<br><br>Pour cake batter into a well oiled 9x11 inch baking dish (I use glass) and bake for 45 minutes, or until golden around the edges. Remove from oven, and let cool for about 10 minutes.<br><br>Glaze:<br><br>Combine first three ingredients and slowly drizzle over cake.  Sprinkle with shredded coconut, if desired.<br><br>Because this cake contains no flour, it is a bit crumbly, but becomes less crumbly if stored in the fridge overnight.
