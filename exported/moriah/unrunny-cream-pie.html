            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Pie Crust:<br>Mix graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and margarine. Transfer into a 9 inch pie pan and press into the sides and bottom with a spoon. Refrigerate. <br><br>Pie Filling:<br>In a food processor, blend tofu until totally smooth (2-3 minutes). While tofu is blending put water in a sauce pan, and slowly whisk in rice flour. Then turn on the heat and cook on medium heat stirring constantly until mixture thickens. Keep stirring until it turns into a thick, smooth, sticky paste. (This should occur pretty quickly and should not be lumpy at all. If it is lumpy, it wasn&#x27;t mixed all the way prior to putting the heat on and you should start over.) <br><br>Add rice flour mixture into the food processor with the tofu and continue to blend. Add remaining ingredients (sugar, vanilla, lemon juice, &amp; salt) and mix well. <br><br>Spoon filling into crust and refrigerate for an hour.
