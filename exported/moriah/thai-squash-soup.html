                Quarter the squash and remove the seeds. Steam the squash over boiling water for 15 minutes, until the squash is soft. Scrape the squash away from the tough rind and set aside. In a 2 quart saucepan, simmer the coconut milk, stock, tom yum hot &amp; sour soup mix, roasted red chili paste, brown sugar, salt and optional lemon grass for 5 minutes. While the coconut milk mixture is simmering, purÃ©e the squash in a food processor, blender, or with a potato masher. Add the squash purÃ©e to the coconut milk mixture and stir well to combine. Simmer for 5 minutes and garnish with optional cilantro. Remove the lemon grass sections and serve immediately. Serves 4
