            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Preheat the oven to 400°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place the cauliflower florets in the bowl of a large food processor fitted with an &quot;S&quot; blade, and pulse until a rice-like texture is created. Pour the cauliflower &quot;rice&quot; to a large sauce pot, add enough water to cover, and bring to a boil. Cover, reduce the heat and allow to cook for 5 minutes. Drain the liquid, then transfer the cooked cauliflower rice in a freezer-safe bowl. Place in the freezer to cool for 10 minutes.<br>In the meantime, mix together 2 T of ground chia or flax seeds with 6 T of water, to create a vegan &quot;egg.&quot; Set aside and allow the mixture to thicken.<br>Remove the cooled cauliflower rice from the freezer and transfer it to the center of a thin dish towel. Use your hands to squeeze the rice in the dish towel, removing all of the excess moisture from the cauliflower.<br>Place the drained cauliflower in a large bowl, then add in the vegan egg mixture, the almond meal, the additional T of ground flax or chia seeds, salt, garlic and dried oregano. Stir well to mix, then press the mixture into the parchment-lined baking sheet. (I used a quarter baking sheet, so the crust filled the entire pan. If you are using a larger baking sheet, simply use your hands to shape the crust into your desired size, keeping the crust about 1/4&quot; thick.) For best results, press the crust together firmly, making sure that there are no &quot;thin spots&quot; where it might crack.<br>Bake at 400°F for 30 minutes, until the top is lightly golden and dry to the touch.<br>You could use this pizza crust as is, but it won&#x27;t be firm enough to lift with your hands. For best texture, I recommend using an additional piece of parchment paper to flip the entire pizza crust, then returning it to the pan to bake for an additional 15 minutes.<br>Once the crust is firm and dry, add your favorite pizza toppings and return to the oven briefly to let everything heat up, about 5-10 additional minutes. I added marinara sauce, sautéed onions, fresh spinach and a sprinkling of cashew parmesan, for a properly combined pizza.<br><br>Notes:<br>You can skip the cooking and cooling process when using frozen cauliflower. Simply allow the frozen cauliflower to thaw in your fridge overnight, which creates a &quot;cooked&quot; texture without having to do the extra work. Pulse the thawed cauliflower to create the rice, then drain well using a dish towel.
