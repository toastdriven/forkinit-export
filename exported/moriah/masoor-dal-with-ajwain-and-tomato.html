                1. Pick over and rinse the lentils and add them to a pot with the water and turmeric. Bring to a boil and reduce heat to low. Simmer until the dal is tender, about 20 to 35 minutes. When done, add salt and set aside.<br><br>2. Put the 1/8 tsp oil in the center of a non-stick pot and heat over medium-high. When hot, add the ajwain and cumin seeds and cook for 1 minute. Add the onion and cook until translucent. Add the ginger paste, garlic, and tomato and cook until the tomato is softened.<br><br>3. Add the dal to the tomato mixture and stir well. Cook for 15 minutes, until flavors have blended. Serve with rice or your choice of Indian bread.<br><br>P.S. An added benefit of ajwain is that it&#x27;s supposed to ease &quot;digestive discomfort.&quot; So eat up those ajwain-enhanced legumes!<br><br>Makes 4 servings.
