            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                &lt;b&gt;Biscuits&lt;/b&gt;<br>1. Preheat oven to 425Ã‚Â°F and spray a baking sheet lightly with cooking spray. <br>2. Mix flour together with baking powder, baking soda, salt and sugar and sift into a medium sized bowl. <br>3. Using a pastry cutter or wire whisk, cut butter into flour until the mixture becomes the consistency of fine crumbs. Pour milk into dry ingredients all at once and mix together with a fork. As soon as mixture holds together, turn out onto a floured work surface and knead gently. <br>4. Roll dough gently out to 1/2&quot; thickness and cut into 2 1/2&quot; round with a floured cutter. <br>5. For crustier biscuits, place rounds about 1&quot; apart on baking sheet. For softer sides, place biscuits touching or 1/4&quot; apart. Dust tops lightly with flour and bake for 10-12 minutes or until golden brown.<br><br>&lt;b&gt;Gravy&lt;/b&gt;<br>1. Melt butter in saucepan.  <br>2. Blend in corn starch, salt and seasoning.  <br>3. Gradually add milk.  <br>4. Heat to boiling; 2 minutes stirring constantly.<br><br>Make biscuits first so the gravy can be made while they are baking.  Use any flavored tofu you desire, or marinate plain tofu, and cut into small cubes.  Arrange tofu on a plate and heat if desired, put biscuits on top and cover with gravy.  Add extra seasoning on top.  Enjoy!
