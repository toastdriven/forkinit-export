                Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Grease and flour a 9x13&quot; cake pan and set aside. Do not use a fragile pan as the topping is briefly broiled - we used a regular glass 9x13. In a medium bowl, combine the oats with the boiling water and let stand for 5-10 minutes (10 for regular oats). In a mixing bowl, cream together the butter and sugars until fluffy. Add the oats and mix. Add the Egg Replacer and vanilla and mix very well. In a separate bowl, sift together the flour, baking soda, salt and cinnamon. Gradually add to the oat mixture and mix well. Pour into the pan. Bake for 30-35 minutes, until brown and a knife comes out clean. Remove from the oven.<br><br>Preheat the broiler. In a bowl, combine all the topping ingredients and mix well. The mixture will be thick. Spread evenly over the warm cake. The warmth of the cake will help the topping spread more easily. Place the cake back in the oven under the broiler 2&quot; from the heat. Broil until browned lightly, 2 to 4 minutes. Cool on a wire rack.
