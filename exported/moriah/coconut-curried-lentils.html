                In a large saut√© pan or medium stockpot, heat onion in oil for 3-5 minutes, until onions are soft. Add spices (curry powder, cumin and cloves) and heat for another minute, stirring to prevent spices from burning.<br><br>Reduce heat to medium low, and add water or vegetable broth and lentils. Cover and cook until lentils are soft, about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally.<br><br>Uncover and stir in coconut milk, cooking just until well heated through. Season with salt and red pepper flakes, and adjust other seasonings to taste.<br><br>Serve your coconut curried lentils paired with rice or another whole grain for a simple vegetarian and vegan Indian-inspired meal.
