            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Begin by preparing the squash for roasting. Cut the squash in half lengthwise and scoop out the seeds. Lay cut side down in a roasting pan and fill halfway with water. Cook in a 200 C (400 F) oven for 40 minutes to 1 hour (adding more water as needed to top up), or until a fork can easily pierce the flesh of the squash. Let cool, then scoop out the flesh.<br><br>In a small bowl combine the 2 T of ground flax with 4 T water. Let sit for 5 minutes.<br>In a larger bowl combine 3 cups of squash with the soaked flax meal, almond flour, garbanzo flour, salt, pepper, dried oregano, and extra ground flax. Stir to combine.<br><br>Spread the mixture onto a parchment lined tray and create a 30 cm (12 inch) circle, making sure that the edges are a little bit thicker. Bake in a 220 C (425 F) for 30-35 minutes or until the edges are crisp and golden and the center is set. Top with pizza sauce, tomatoes, and olives, and bake for another 10 minutes. Let sit a few minutes before garnishing with greens.<br><br>Green Pizza Sauce:<br>In a food processor pur√©e the cashews, basil, and spinach until smooth. Add the salt, pepper, lemon juice, and oil; mix to combine.
