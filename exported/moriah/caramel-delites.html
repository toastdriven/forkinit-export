            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Cookie Base:<br>In a large mixing bowl combine the almond flour, ground coconut and salt.  Mix together.<br>Add the date paste, maple syrup and almond extract. With your hands mix everything together until a dough forms. If the dough is too dry, add 1 T water.<br>Roll out the dough by placing the dough ball in the center of a teflex sheet that comes with the dehydrator or on parchment/wax paper. Place another sheet on top and with a rolling pin, roll the dough out to about 1/4″ thick. Remove the top sheet.<br>Cut out the circles with cookie cutters. I used  2 cookie cutters. The large one was 2 1/2″ diameter and a small one for the center that was 1/2″ in diameter. Use what you have on hand. Depending on the size you use, it will change the yield amount.<br>After cutting out the circles, roll the remaining dough back out and cut out more circles; do this process over and over until all the dough is used up. I ended up with a small ball of batter that I rolled into a ball and flattened. This was the taste tester. :)<br>Place the cut out cookies on the mesh sheet that comes with the dehydrator and dry at 115°F for 16 hours or until desired dryness is reached.<br><br>Caramel &amp; Coconut Layer:<br>In the same mixing bowl mix together the date paste, almond butter, maple syrup, vanilla and sea salt.<br>Add in the coconut and cacao powder. Mix well so everything is well integrated.<br>Place in a piping bag fitted with a 1/2″ tip. Leave on the counter while the cookies dehydrate. This will keep in soft and pliable when you are ready to use it. You can skip the piping process and just use a butter knife but I found piping it made it fast, easy and clean.<br><br>Chocolate Drizzle:<br>Place the coconut oil, cacao, and maple syrup in the blender and blend until it turns smooth and creamy.<br>Place a piping bag, fitted with a small circular tip (put a piece of tape over the hole) in a tall glass, folding a cuff over the edge.<br>Pour the chocolate sauce in the bag and place in the fridge for 15 minutes to firm up a bit.<br>Tip: To melt the coconut oil, place the jar in a large bowl of hot water.<br>Tip: You can hand mix this, but I find that it doesn’t get as creamy and you risk having grainy cacao bits in it.<br>Tip: If you don’t have a piping bag, you can use a zip-lock bag.  When the time comes to piping the chocolate, snip a small corner off of the bottom.<br>This recipe will create more chocolate sauce than what is needed but it will store in the fridge for several weeks so you can use it over all sorts of yummy raw treats!<br><br>Assembly:<br>Place about 1/4 C of shredded coconut on a small plate.<br>Pipe a rope of caramel &amp; coconut batter on top of the cookie.  With a damp finger pat down the edges, smoothing it out.<br>Turn the cookie upside down and press lightly into the shredded coconut.<br>Pipe strips of chocolate over the top of the cookie and enjoy!<br>Store in the fridge or on the counter top.  These would freeze well, but be sure to store them in a single layer so you don’t mess up the top.
