            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Upset GI tract?  Add dill.  Indian scientists found that dill&#x27;s limonene works as well as prescription antibiotics at killing harmful intestinal bacteria such as E. coli.<br><br>Congested?  Add cayenne.  The fiery capsaicin in cayenne deactivates substance P, a neurotransmitter linked to inflammation.  The result: less sinus congestion and pressure.<br><br>Always tired?  Add cilantro.  The carboxylic acid in cilantro binds to heavy metals such as mercury in the blood and carries them out of the body.  Their removal reverses the toxin buildup that causes chronic fatigue, joint pain and depression.<br><br>Bloated?  Add parsley.  Thanks to it&#x27;s stores of apiol and myristicin, parsley is a natural diuretic that relieves bloat-inducing water retention by preventing salt from being reabsorbed into bodily tissue.<br><br>Feeling down?  Add basil.  The eugenol and rosmarinic acid in basil boost the brain&#x27;s production of dopamine and serotonin.  According to Indian researchers, this could lead to sunnier moods in as little as three days.<br><br>Nauseous?  Add ginger.  Ginger&#x27;s gingerol and shogaol calm digestive-tract spasms to reduce nausea better than motion-sickness drugs, according to a study at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah.
