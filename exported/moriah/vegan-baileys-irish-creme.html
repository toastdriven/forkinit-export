                1 can light coconut milk<br>1 can full-fat coconut milk<br>1/2 cup Sucanat (or brown sugar should work)<br>3/4 cup strong espresso or coffee, or to taste<br>3/4-1 cup Jameson Irish Whiskey, or to taste<br>pinch of salt

            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                In a medium or large pot, add the cans of coconut milk and whisk. Now whisk in the sugar. Bring to a low boil, stirring frequently. Simmer for about 8-10 minutes, while stirring frequently, until it cooks down and thickens slightly.<br><br>Remove from heat and stir in the espresso or coffee. Don’t have a coffee maker? Just buy a cup from the coffee shop and use that. Add in espresso/coffee to taste.<br><br>Add a pinch of salt and finally the Jameson, to taste. I added about 3/4 + 2 tbsp of whiskey and it was strong, but so is the original! Make it as strong or weak as you prefer.<br><br>Store in sealed jars and serve over ice, with coffee or tea, or in baked goods. The whiskey and espresso settles to the bottom of the jar slightly, so give it a good stir before using. I’m not positive how long this keeps in the fridge, but it’s been good in our fridge for a couple days now and I expect it to last 4-5 days. Well, not technically…!
