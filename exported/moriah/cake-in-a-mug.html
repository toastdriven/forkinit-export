            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. Spray a little cooking spray into the mug.<br>2. Measure out the flour and hot chocolate mix into the mug. Stir.<br>3. Crack the egg into the mug. Stir a bit after adding the egg so the cup doesn&#x27;t overflow. <br>4. Add water and oil.<br>5. Stir until thoroughly moistened. Make sure to scrape the bottom of the mug with your spoon to avoid any leftover pockets of dry ingredients. <br>6. Put the mug in the microwave on high and set the timer for 3 minutes.<br>7. As it bakes, a cylinder of cake will start to rise out of the mug. Way cool!<br>8. When done, it will settle back into the mug.  The handle of the mug may be hot, so use a potholder to remove it from the microwave.<br>9. Tip your cake cylinder out of the mug into a dish. Your cake may look a little damp and wrinkled. This is normal. <br>10. Use a fork to break it up into quarters. This will allow steam in the center to escape. Arrange so that the more attractive interior of the cake is showing. <br>11. Make sure the cake has cooled enough to eat before digging in. Add whipped cream or ice cream if desired.<br><br>Variation<br>For added sweetness and gooeyness, after you mix up the batter throw in a few chocolate chips. They may sink to the bottom, but they will taste fine. Mini marshmallows also add a great taste to the cake. They do tend to bubble out, so be sure to protect your microwave tray with paper towel for easy clean-up.<br><br>If you want a glaze-like layer on the outside of the cake, try using some chocolate or butterscotch syrup. This absorbs into the cake and makes it more sweet and delicious.<br><br>Clean Up<br>Although the cooking spray will help, it may still require soaking.<br>After use, fill the mug with water and let soak. Then wash by hand. Throwing the mug in the dishwasher will result in baked-on batter that will be harder to get off than if you just washed it by hand in the first place.<br><br>Share your Cake in a Mug with others<br>No, not literally (unless you&#x27;re on a diet). But a decorative mug filled with a baggie of measured-out dry ingredients and the recipe for Cake in a Mug is a great gift idea for a friend or loved one. <br><br>Makes enough for one enormous serving.
