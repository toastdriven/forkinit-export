                Fritters:<br><br>Combine flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, cinnamon.<br><br>Stir in milk and applesauce until just combined.<br><br>Fold in apple.<br><br>Pour oil into saucepan so that it is approximately a little less than 1/2 full.<br><br>Heat oil on high. The oil is ready when dough floats to top. Carefully add dough to oil in heaping tablespoons. Cook until brown, about 2 minutes, then flip. Cook another 1-2 minutes, until both sides are browned. Transfer gently to paper towels to absorb excess oil, then transfer to cooling rack.<br><br>Glaze:<br><br>Make the glaze by stirring the milk and powdered sugar together in a small bowl. Drizzle over apple fritters. Wait approximately 3 minutes for glaze to harden, then flip fritters and drizzle glaze over the other side.
