            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. In a small saucepan, bring the cream, margarine, and corn syrup to a full boil over medium heat. Turn off the heat. Add 1 lb of chocolate. Gently swirl the pan to cover the chocolate with cream, but do not stir. Let stand for 5 minutes.<br>2. Slowly whisk until combined. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl. Refrigerate, stirring every 15 minutes. After 45 minutes, the mixture will thicken quickly, so stir every 3 to 5 minutes until thick enough to scoop.<br>3. Form 1&quot; balls. Transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Chill until firm.<br>4. Melt the remaining 12 oz chocolate in the top of a double boiler. Remove from the heat and cool slightly.<br>5. Place the cocoa or confectionerâ€™s sugar in a bowl. Dip a truffle into the melted chocolate, coating it with a thin layer. Place the truffle in the cocoa or sugar and roll to cover. Set the truffle on a clean parchment-lined baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining truffles. Refrigerate to set.<br><br>Makes about 4 dozen truffles.
