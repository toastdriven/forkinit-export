            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. Preheat oven to 375Â°F.  Cream together the butter and sugar.  Add the egg and the Vanilla, mix until well blended.  In a separate bowl, stir together the flour and baking powder, then gradually add to the butter mixture and blend well on low speed.  Knead the dough briefly into a smooth ball.  Place the dough on a pizza pan and pat out gently to the edges.  Bake 10-12 minutes until the crust is golden brown on the edges.  Let cool before topping.<br>2. To prepare to topping, start with the fruit.  The strawberries need a little time in the Vanilla Sugar to be at their best.  Rinse the strawberries, and set aside the most perfect one for the centerpiece, or use your most perfect raspberry for the center.  Quarter the rest of the strawberries, place in a small bowl and sprinkle with Vanilla Sugar.  Stir vigorously to get the strawberry juice to start, then cover and set aside.  Gently wash the raspberries and blueberries, discarding any soft berries.  Hopefully you will have enough nice raspberries left to make a ring around the whole cookie.<br>3. Using a mixer on high speed, whip the cream cheese with the sugar and Pure Vanilla Extract until creamy.  Spread over the cooled cookie crust almost to the edge.  Make a nice design with the blueberries and raspberries, starting with the one perfect strawberry in the middle.  Spoon some of the stawberries on randomly - everything shouldn&#x27;t look perfect.  Mix the Raspberry Enlightenment into the strawberry syrup left at the bottom of the strawberry bowl - this will thicken it just enough to make a nice glaze.  If there is a lot of strawberry syrup in the bowl, discard all but 1/3 C and add the Raspberry Enlightenment to that.  You don&#x27;t need too much glaze - just a bit will do.  Use a spoon to drizzle the glaze over the berries, refrigerate until ready to serve.  Refrigerating the cookie will thicken the glaze a bit more.  As delicious as it is beautiful.
