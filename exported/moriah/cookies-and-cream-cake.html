                In a large mixing bowl, combine cake mix, water, oil and egg whites (or Egg Replacer).  Beat on low speed until moistened; beat on high for 2 minutes.  Gently fold in the crushed cookies.  Pour into two greased and floured 8&quot; round cake pans.  Bake at 350Â°F for 30 minutes or until a wooden pick inserted in the center comes out clean.  Cool for 10 minutes; remove from pans to wire rack to cool completely.  In a mixing bowl, beat sugar, shortening, milk and vanilla until smooth.  Frost cake.  If desired, decorate the top with cookie halves and the sides with crushed cookies.<br>Yield:  12 servings
