            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. Preheat oven to 350Ã‚Â°F.  To peel the peaches, bring a medium pot of water to a boil.  Drop the peaches in the water and leave them for 10 to 30 seconds, depending on the ripeness of the fruit (10 seconds for very ripe fruit, 30 seconds for firm fruit).  If the peaches are very firm, remove them after 30 seconds.  Remove peaches and place them in a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking process.  Peel, halve and pit the peaches.  Slice them.  You should have about 5 or 6 C.<br>2. Toss peaches with the lemon juice, sugar and ginger in a large bowl to combine well.  Drain the juices and discard or reserve for another use.  Spread peaches evenly in an 8x8 or 2-quart baking dish.<br>3. For the crisp topping, put flour, oats, brown sugar, salt and butter in a food processor.  Pulse several times to incorporate the butter into the flour, until the mixture resembles coarse meal.  Spread the topping evenly over the fruit, pressing down lightly with your fingers.  Bake for 40 to 50 minutes or until the juices are bubbly and the topping is golden brown.  Serve warm or at room temperature.
