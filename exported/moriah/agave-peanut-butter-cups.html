            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Prep Tip: You&#x27;ll need small fluted paper candy cups, available at hobby or candy-making supply stores, and a small pastry brush.<br><br>Arrange paper candy cups on a rimmed baking sheet, and make space for it in your refrigerator.  In a medium bowl, mix peanut butter with agave until smooth.  Cover and chill until ready to use.<br>Melt chocolate in a bowl set over a pan of hot water, stirring frequently until melted and smooth.  Remove from heat.  With a small pastry brush, apply a generous layer of chocolate inside each paper candy cup.  You want the cups to be sturdy enough to hold the peanut butter, so be sure to coat the bottom and sides well.  Place baking sheet in refrigerator until chocolate hardens, about 30 minutes.<br>Reheat remaining chocolate until smooth.  Spoon about 1/2 T peanut-butter mixture into each chocolate cup.  With a clean spoon, quickly spoon remaining melted chocolate evenly over peanut butter to cover.  Refrigerate until chocolate hardens, about 20 minutes.  Refrigerate in an airtight container for up to two weeks.
