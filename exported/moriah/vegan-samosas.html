                1. Boil: Dice potatoes, tumble into a saucepan, cover with cold water and set over high heat. Boil until soft, 5-10 minutes. Drain.<br><br>2. Knead: Measure flour and 1 tsp salt into the food processor; pulse to blend. Cut half the soy margarine into bits, add to the flour; pulse to combine. Add the plain soy yogurt, better than sour cream or plain soymilk and pulse a few more times. With the machine running, add ice water 1 T at a time through the feed tube. As soon as the dough forms a ball, stop. Turn out and knead 1 minute by hand. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside.<br><br>3. Soften: Melt 1 T remaining soy margarine in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and chili and cook, stirring, until the onions soften, 5 minutes. Add the garlic, ginger, salt, pepper and curry powder; 1 T for mild samosas, 3 T for spicy. Cook, stirring, 2 minutes. Add the remaining 3 T soy margarine; when melted, add the potatoes, raise the heat a little and cook until potatoes begin to brown, 8 minutes. Add peas, cook 2 more minutes. Adjust seasoning; the mixture should be spicy but not fiery. Cool the filling while you roll out the dough.<br><br>4. Shape: Knead the dough a few seconds, sprinkling with a little flour if necessary. Break off a ping-pong ball of dough and, flatten with a rolling pin to a thin oval. Cut in half the short way. You now have 2 humped triangles. Run a wet finger around the edge of one. Mound about 1 T potato mixture in the center. Pinch the sides together over the filling, forming a tall pyramid, which, when stood on its small end resembles a wizard&#x27;s hat. Keep finished samosas covered with a damp kitchen towel while rolling and filling the rest.<br><br>5. Fry: Pour oil into a large deep saucepan to a depth of 2 inches. Heat over medium-high heat to 375 degrees. Fry the samosas a few at a time, turning once or twice, until golden brown, 2 minutes. Drain on paper towels or paper bags. Serve immediately or keep warm in a low oven. These are nice plain or with chutney.<br><br>Makes 20 to 30
