            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Take 2 cloves or 2 garlic tablets 3x per day for 10 days.<br>Eat as many fresh blueberries as you want. They contain some of the same UTI-fighting enzymes as cranberries.<br>Drink 3-4 oz of pure cranberry juice 2x daily for 10 days.<br>Drink 1/2-1 C raw almond milk combined with 1/2-1 C barley water* daily for urinary problems.<br>Take 1-2 CranActin chewables to support a healthy urinary tract as needed.<br>Take 5-10 alfalfa tablets daily, and drink up to 4 oz freshly-squeezed wheatgrass juice daily to cleanse and detox the system.<br><br>*Barley Water<br>Place the whole barley, water, the cinnamon stick and some grated ginger into a pan and simmer for 20 minutes. If you have organic unwaxed lemons you can simmer the peel for the final 5 minutes which intensifies the taste.<br><br>After cooling, strain the mixture and finally add fresh lemon juice for extra flavor. Store in a cool place and drink between 1 and 3 cups daily, diluted to your taste if necessary.
