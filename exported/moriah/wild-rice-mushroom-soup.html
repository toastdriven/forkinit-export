                In a large Dutch oven or stockpot, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Saut√© the onion, celery, carrot and bell pepper for 5-10 minutes before adding the garlic, mushrooms, thyme, white wine and a pinch of salt. Cook for a few minutes until the mushrooms start to soften. Add the rice and broth and stir well. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, cover and simmer 30 minutes or until rice is tender. Add the spinach and cook for a few more minutes. Stir in the milk and season to taste with salt and ground black pepper. Serve warm.
