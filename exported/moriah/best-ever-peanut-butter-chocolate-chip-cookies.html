            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. Mix sugars, margarine, peanut-butter, eggs and vanilla until smooth. Gradually add baking soda, salt, and flour, mixing until well blended. Add chocolate chips and mix until chips are evenly distributed.<br>2. Make into balls about an inch and a half in diameter, and place (slightly flattened) on ungreased cookie sheet. (If you want to make Ã¢â‚¬Å“monsterÃ¢â‚¬Â cookies, use an ice-cream scoop to measure the balls, and flatten them well.) Bake at 375Ã‚Â° for 10 to 12 minutes. Do not overbake!<br>3. Cookies should be light brown when done, and soft. Cool them on a wire rack until firm, and store in an air-tight container. Makes 40-50 cookies (or about 10-12 monster cookies).
