                1.  In large, heavy pot over medium-high heat, heat oil. Saute onion, garlic, jalapeno, and ginger until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add curry powder and pumpkin. Cook and stir for 1 minute.<br>2. Stir in coconut milk and rice milk; bring to a boil. Lower to a simmer; cover and cook for 15 minutes. Add more milk or water if needed.<br>3. Add tofu and red bell pepper. Simmer for another 5 to 10 minutes, uncovered, or until pumpkin is tender. Season with lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Garnish with whole cilantro leaves. Serve hot.<br><br>Notes:<br><br>Serve this stew over brown rice or with whole-grain bread. You can also replace the pumpkin with squash or young carrots. The tofu, which is added to the stew in the last 5 to 10 minutes, absorbs the spicy flavors of the broth.
