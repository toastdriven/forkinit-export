                Begin by slicing the peaches and tossing them into a 9x13&quot; baking pan. Then add the agave nectar and nutmeg, mixing with your hands. Set aside to soak.<br><br>Combine the batter ingredients and stir until smooth. Pour this batter to completely cover the peaches in the pan. Note: this will be liquid-y and will fall in the cracks of the peaches, not really staying on top. It is supposed to do this!<br><br>For the crumble topping, simply combine those ingredients until it becomes a very thick, crumbly dough. Using your hands, break this into small…well, crumbles…and sprinkle on top of the peaches. You should have enough to completely cover the entire dish so all you see crumb topping, as you see here.<br><br>Place in the oven at 375°F for 35 minutes. Once the timer goes off, take out for just a moment and sprinkle the top with a mixture of cinnamon and brown sugar (use your own judgments for how much of this you want…I maybe used about 2 tbsp of sugar and 2 tsp of cinnamon). Place in for 5-7 more minutes. Remove, let cool, and then enjoy!
