            A hearty (and affordable!) vegan stew that&#x27;s perfect for a packed lunch or weeknight meal.

            <h3 class="underline">Ingredients</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1 tablespoon coconut oil<br>1 yellow onion<br>3 carrots<br>3 celery stalks<br>4 cloves garlic<br>1 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin<br>1/2 teaspoon ground ginger<br>1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric<br>2 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste<br>1 cup red lentils<br>1/2 cup dry quinoa<br>5 cups water<br>26 1/2 oz box of chopped tomatoes<br>2 cups chopped kale
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-8">
            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Melt the coconut oil in a large pot over medium heat and sauté the onions, carrots, and celery until tender, about 8 minutes.<br>Add in the minced garlic and sauté another minute, just until fragrant.<br>Add in the cumin, ginger, turmeric, salt, lentils, quinoa, water, and tomatoes and bring the soup to a boil. Once boiling, lower the heat and cover the pot to let everything simmer until the lentils are tender, about 20 minutes.<br>Once the lentils and vegetables are very tender, stir in the chopped kale and cook until it&#x27;s wilted, just a few minutes. Season with additional salt, if desired, (I added a 1/2 tsp myself) and serve warm.<br>Leftovers can be stored in the fridge for up to 4 days, and I think this would make a great packed lunch in a thermos for the week, too!
