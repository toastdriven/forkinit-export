            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. In a large mixing bowl, stir together 2 C of the all-purpose flour and the yeast; set aside.  In a medium saucepan, heat and stir apple cider or juice, milk, brown sugar, 1 T margarine and salt until warm (115Ã‚Â° to 120Ã‚Â°F), and margarine is almost melted (mixture will appear curdled).  Add apple cider mixture to flour mixture.  Add Egg Replacer.  Beat with an electric mixer on low speed for 30 seconds, scraping sides of the bowl constantly.  Then beat on high speed for 3 minutes.  Using a wooden spoon, stir in whole wheat flour and as much of the remaining all-purpose flour as you can.<br>2. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface.  Knead in enough of the remaining all-purpose flour to make a moderately soft dough that is smooth and elastic (6 to 8 minutes total).  Spray a large bowl with nonstick cooking spray.  Place dough in bowl, turning dough once to coat surface of the dough.  Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size (about 1 hour).<br>3. Punch dough down.  Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface.  Divide dough in half.  Cover and let rest 10 minutes.  Meanwhile, pour enough boiling water over raisins to cover them.  Let stand 10 minutes; drain.  Spray 2 baking sheets with nonstick cooking spray.<br>4. Roll each half of the dough into a 12x8&quot; rectangle.  Brush dough with 1 T melted margarine.  In a small mixing bowl, stir together raisins, sugar and cinnamon; sprinkle half of the mixture evenly over each dough rectangle to within 1&quot; of edges.  Tightly roll up, jelly-roll style, starting from one of the long sides.  Seal with your fingertips as you roll.<br>5. Place loaves on prepared baking sheets.  With sharp knife, cut 4 diagonal slashes in top of each loaf.  Brush loaves with water.  Cover and let rise in warm place until doubled in size (30 to 40 minutes).<br>6. Bake in a 375Ã‚Â°F oven for 25 to 30 minutes or until bread sounds hollow when you tap the top with your fingers (if necessary, cover loosely with foil the last 10 minutes of baking to prevent overbrowning).  Immediately remove bread from pans.  Cool on wire racks.  Makes 2 loaves.
