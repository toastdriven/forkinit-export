            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                In a saucepan, bring water to a boil; add oats and margarine.  Cook and stir for 1 minute.  Remove from the heat; cool to lukewarm.  In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water.  Add the oat mixture, sugars, salt and 4 cups of the flour; beat until smooth.  Add enough remaining flour to form a soft dough.  Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes.  Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top.  Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.  Punch dough down; allow to rest for 10 minutes.  Shape into 18 balls.  Place in two 9&quot; round baking pans coated with nonstick cooking spray.  Cover and let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes.  Bake at 350Ã‚Â°F for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown.  Remove from pan to wire racks.<br>Yield:  1 1/2 dozen
