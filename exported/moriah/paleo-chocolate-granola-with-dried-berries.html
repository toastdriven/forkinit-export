            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Soak all of the nuts in enough water to cover them and mix in 1 teaspoon of salt. Cover, and soak overnight, changing out the water one time. Soak the sunflower seeds in a separate bowl, following the same procedure as above.<br>Drain the nuts and seeds and place on a paper towel to absorb the remaining water. Keep half of the sunflower seeds separate.<br>Place all of the nuts and half of the sunflower seeds in the bowl of a food processor. Grind them until they resemble the size of oats.<br>Melt the coconut oil, honey, vanilla, and cacao over medium heat until the cacao has dissolved.<br>Add in the coconut oil mixture, cinnamon, and sea salt. Pulse until combined.<br>Next, add the last half of the sunflower seeds and the flax seeds and pulse once or twice, until they are roughly chopped and mixed into the nut mixture.<br>Remove the blade, then mix in the shredded coconut with a spoon. Turn the mixture out onto 3 parchment covered dehydrator trays. Spread it evenly into a thin layer.<br>Dehydrate on 120 degrees for 24 hours, turning twice. The granola may feel a little sticky and wet when you first remove it, but will crisp up after cooling.<br>Once cooled, stir in the chocolate and strawberries, and store in an airtight container for 2-3 weeks.
