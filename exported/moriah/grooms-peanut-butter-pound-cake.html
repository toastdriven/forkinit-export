                Do NOT preheat oven before baking this cake!  It will be easier to frost if it bakes from a cold oven.<br><br>Lightly grease and flour a 10&quot; tube pan and set aside.  In a large bowl, cream together the butter and peanut butter.  Add the sugar and beat until light in color.  Add the Egg Replacer, a little at a time, mixing well in between.  The mixture should be a bit light and fluffy.  Add the vanilla.<br><br>In a smaller bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder and salt.  Gradually add to the butter mixture, alternating with the milk, beginning and ending with the flour mixture.  Mix the batter until smooth and creamy.  Pour into the cake pan.  Place in the COLD oven.  Set the temperature to 325Â°F and bake until a tester inserted in the cake comes out clean, about 1 hour and 35 minutes.  If you choose to preheat the oven, bake for 1 hour and 25 minutes.  Please note that all ovens are different, so check the cake&#x27;s progress after 1 hour and 10 minutes.  Let the cake cool in the pan for 30 minutes before turning out on a rack to cool completely before icing.<br><br>For the icing: Place the chocolate chips in a small mixing bowl.  Heat the coconut milk solids in a heavy-bottomed saucepan until boiling.  Pour over chocolate chips and stir until creamy and smooth.  Let cool for 2-3 minutes.  Brush any loose crumbs from the cake.  Place the cooling rack on a clean baking sheet to catch the drips.  Pour the icing evenly over the cake, allowing it to cascade and cover the cake.  Move the cake rack to another clean baking sheet.  Scrape the drips from the first baking sheet, reheat and pour over the cake.
