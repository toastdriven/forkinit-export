            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Preheat oven to 400°F and wrap tofu in a clean, absorbent towel and set something heavy on top (like a cast iron skillet or tea pot) to begin drying.<br>Add chopped onion and cauliflower to a large mixing bowl with 2 T oil, 3 T masala spice blend and a healthy pinch each salt and pepper and toss to combine. You want it very heavily seasoned - almost all visibly coated - so add more spice if necessary.<br>Add to a lightly greased or foil lined baking sheet and bake for 20 minutes.<br>In the meantime, add kale to the mixing bowl you used before and toss with another dash of oil and a shake of masala spice and salt and pepper. Massage to coat.<br>At the 20 minute mark, stir cauliflower and onion to cook evenly and add the kale to one end of the baking sheet. Bake for 5 minutes more.<br>Move onto the tofu while veggies are baking: Preheat large skillet to medium, medium-high heat.<br>While heating, to the same mixing bowl you used before, add the tofu and use a fork to piece it apart. Add chopped olives, 1 T oil and another healthy shake (~ 1 heaping T) masala blend and salt and pepper. Optional: I also added a dash of hot sauce for color. If using parsley, add half at this time for color and reserve the rest for garnish/serving.<br>Once the pan is hot, add a bit more oil and then the tofu mixture. Continue cooking and stirring (adding more masala if desired) for about 5 minutes, or until it looks visibly browned and dry.<br>To serve, place the cauliflower/kale/onion mixture on the serving plates and top with tofu scramble. Garnish with a bit more fresh parsley and serve with hot sauce and breakfast potatoes, if desired. Although, I think it’s perfect on its own.<br>Store leftovers in the fridge, covered for up to 2 days, though best when fresh.<br><br>Notes:<br>Serve with roasted baby red potatoes.<br>DIY Tandoori Masala Blend: 3 T cumin, 2 T garlic powder, 2 T paprika, 3 tsp ginger, 2 tsp coriander, 2 tsp cardamom. Multiply as needed.<br>Inspired by the Masala Tofu Scramble at Bijou Cafe in Portland, OR.
