                1. Preheat oven to 350Ã‚Â°F.<br>2. In 13&quot;x9&quot; pan, spread a thin layer of pasta sauce to cover the bottom.  If using 9 noodles, first lay down 3 noodles (otherwise start with the vegetable layer).  Spread thin layer of sauce onto noodles and cover with herbs and garlic.  Top with 3 C of the vegetables and sprinkle on 1/2 C cheese.  Top with 3 noodles.  Spread on another layer of sauce and cover with herbs and garlic.  Top with remaining 3 C of vegetables and another 1/2 C cheese.  Top with final 3 noodles, spread the rest of the sauce on top, cover with herbs and garlic, and top with remaining 3 C cheese.<br>3. Cover pan with aluminum foil, shiny side down to avoid heat reflection, and bake for one hour.  When finished baking, uncover, cut and garnish with fresh herbs if desired.  Enjoy!
