                3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon lukewarm water (105-115°F)<br>1 package active dry yeast (2 1/4 teaspoons)<br>1 teaspoon sugar<br>1 cup whole-wheat pastry flour (see Tips)<br>1 cup bread flour or all-purpose flour<br>1/2 teaspoon salt<br>

            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Stir water, yeast and sugar in a large bowl; let stand until the yeast has dissolved, about 5 minutes. Stir in whole-wheat flour, bread flour (or all-purpose flour) and salt until the dough begins to come together.<br><br>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Knead until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. (Alternatively, mix the dough in a food processor or in a stand mixer with a dough hook. Process or mix until it forms a ball. Continue to process until the dough is smooth and elastic, about 1 minute more in a food processor or 4 to 5 minutes more on low speed in a stand mixer.) Place the dough in an oiled bowl and turn to coat.<br><br>Cover with a clean kitchen towel; set aside in a warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.<br><br>Tips &amp; Notes:<br><br>Make Ahead Tip: Prepare through Step 2, cover and refrigerate for up to 1 day. Or tightly wrap the unrisen dough in oiled plastic wrap and freeze for up to 3 months. Defrost in the refrigerator overnight. Let refrigerated or defrosted dough stand at room temperature for 1 hour before using.<br><br>Tips: Whole-wheat pastry flour is milled from soft wheat. It contains less gluten than regular whole-wheat flour and helps ensure a tender result in delicate baked goods while providing the nutritional benefits of whole grains. Find it at large supermarkets and natural-foods stores. Store in an airtight container in the freezer.<br>    <br>To Roll Out Pizza Dough: Turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Dust with flour; dimple with your fingertips to shape into a thick, flattened circle. Then use a rolling pin to roll into the desired shape. If your dough “resists” being rolled out, let it rest for about 15 minutes, then try rolling it out again.
