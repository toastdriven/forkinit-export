            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1/4 cup chia seeds<br>1/4 cup dried coconut, shredded &amp; unsweetened<br>1 cup water<br>1/4 cup raw cashews (soaked 1 hour, drained and rinsed)<br>4 soft medjool dates, pitted<br>2 cloves<br>1 teaspoon lucuma powder*<br>1/2 teaspoon powdered ginger<br>1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract<br>1/8 teaspoon cinnamon
            </p>
        </div>

            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Place the chia seeds and coconut in a small bowl, briefly stir to mix, and set aside. Blend the remaining ingredients until smooth. Pour the blended cashew mixture into the bowl with the chia seeds and coconut and stir. Wait a few minutes and stir again. (You’ll notice the chia seeds beginning to take on a gelatinous texture.) Wait a few minutes, again, and stir. Do the “wait and stir” once more, and then place the Holiday Chia Pudding in the refrigerator for about 15 - 20 minutes (or longer, if desired). Then, enjoy. <br><br>Personally, I especially love this recipe when it&#x27;s closer to room temperature, because it&#x27;s like comfort food. So, after it gels in the refrigerator briefly, I like eating it before it gets too cold. However, this recipe will stay fresh when stored in an airtight container for 4-5 days, so feel free to nibble a spoonful here and there - cold or not! It&#x27;s all good!<br><br>*If you don&#x27;t have lucuma, then you can make this recipe without it... still delicious. That being said, I love having a jar of lucuma in my pantry for various recipes, so I recommend getting some.
