            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. Mix 2 C of the flour and the yeast.  Heat and stir milk, molasses, margarine, and salt until warm (115Ã‚Â° to 120Ã‚Â°F).  Add to flour mixture.  Beat with electric mixer on low speed for 30 seconds, scraping bowl.  Beat on high speed 3 minutes.  Stir in 1 C oats and as much remaining flour as you can.  Turn out onto lightly floured surface.  Knead in enough flour to make moderately soft dough that is smooth and elastic (6 to 8 minutes).  Shape into ball.  Spray a bowl with nonstick cooking spray.  Place dough in bowl; turn once to coat surface.  Cover; let rise in warm place until doubled (1 to 1 1/2 hours).<br>2. Punch dough down.  On lightly floured surface divide dough in half.  Cover; let rest 10 minutes.  Shape each half into a 12&quot; log.  Twist logs together; pinch ends.  Place twist on a baking sheet sprayed with nonstick cooking spray.  Brush with water; sprinkle with 2 tsp oats.  Cover; let rest until doubled (30 minutes).  Bake in 375Ã‚Â°F oven 30 to 40 minutes.  Remove from baking sheet; cool.
