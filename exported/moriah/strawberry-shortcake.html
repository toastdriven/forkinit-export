            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. Preheat the oven to 450ÂºF.<br>2. Grease a baking sheet and set it aside. <br>3. In a medium bowl, gently stir together the strawberries and 2 T of sugar. Set aside. <br>4. In a large bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, cream of tartar, and baking soda. Cut in the margarine until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients, then pour in the soymilk mixture all at once. Using a fork, stir until just moistened. <br>5. Divide the dough into quarters and drop each quarter in a mound onto the prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle them with sugar and bake at 450Â°F for 10 to 12 minutes or until golden. <br>6. Split the shortcakes into 2 layers. Place the bottom layers into individual serving bowls. Spoon some of the strawberries and nondairy whipped cream or &#x27;cream cheese&#x27; sauce (see below) over the bottom layers. Add the top layers. Spoon more strawberries and the remaining nondairy whipped cream or &#x27;cream cheese&#x27; sauce over tops. Serve immediately. <br><br>For the &#x27;Cream Cheese&#x27; Sauce: In a small bowl, stir together 1/4 C nondairy sour cream and 4 T nondairy cream cheese (try Tofutti brand at Tofutti.com) with 2 tsp sugar until smooth. <br>Makes 4 servings
