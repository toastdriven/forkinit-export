            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. In a large mixing bowl, stir together 2 1/2 C of the all-purpose flour and the yeast; set aside.  In a medium saucepan, heat and stir water, milk, brown sugar, margarine and salt just until warm (120Ã‚Â° to 130Ã‚Â°F) and margarine almost melts.  Add milk mixture to flour mixture.  Add Egg Replacer.  Beat with an electric mixer on low to medium speed for 30 seconds, scraping the sides of the bowl constantly.  Then beat on high speed for 3 minutes.  Using a wooden spoon, stir in the whole wheat flour, oats, wheat germ and as much of the remaining all-purpose flour as you can.<br>2. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface.  Knead in enough of the remaining all-purpose flour to make a moderately soft dough that is smooth and elastic (6 to 8 minutes).  Shape the dough into a ball.  Spray a large bowl with nonstick cooking spray; place dough in bowl, turning once to coat the surface of the dough.  Cover; let rise in a warm place until nearly doubled in size (about 50 to 60 minutes).<br>3. Punch dough down.  Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface.  Divide dough in half.  Cover and let rest 10 minutes.  Meanwhile, spray two 9x5x3&quot; loaf pans with nonstick cooking spray.<br>4. Shape each portion of the dough into a loaf by patting or rolling.  To shape dough by patting, gently pull dough into a loaf shape, tucking edges underneath.  To shape dough by rolling, on a lightly floured surface, roll each half into a 12x8&quot; rectangle.  Tightly roll up, jelly-roll style, starting from one of the short sides.  Seal with your fingertips as you roll.<br>5. Place the shaped dough in the prepared loaf pans.  Cover and let rise in a warm place until nearly doubled in size (25 to 35 minutes).<br>6. Bake in a 375Ã‚Â°F oven about 30 minutes or until bread sounds hollow when tapped with your fingers (if necessary, cover loosely with foil the last 10 minutes of baking to prevent overbrowning).  Immediately remove bread from pans.  Cool on wire racks.  Makes 2 loaves.
