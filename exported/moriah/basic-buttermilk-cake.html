            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. Arrange the rack at the middle of the oven and preheat to 350Â°F.  Grease cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper or wax paper; grease the paper.  (If you&#x27;re making cupcakes, fill cups with paper liners or grease them.)<br>2. Beat the vegan butter and sugar in a large mixing bowl with an electric mixer for 5 minutes at medium speed until light and fluffy.  Beat in egg replacer, a little at a time.  Scrape the bowl and beaters and beat well to incorporate.<br>3. Sift the flour with the baking powder and baking soda.  Add a quarter of the flour mixture to the butter-egg replacer mixture, then add vanilla and a third of the buttermilk.  Repeat, beginning and ending with the flour mixture and scraping  well after each addition.<br>4. Pour the batter into the prepared pans and spread to edges with a spatula.  Bake 25 to 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.  Cool in pans on a rack for 5 minutes.  Turn pans onto the rack; remove parchment or wax paper and cool completely before frosting.<br><br>Makes two 8&quot; round layers, two dozen cupcakes, one 9x13x2&quot; cake, two 8&quot; square layers, and 10 large muffin-size cakes.
