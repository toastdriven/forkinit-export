            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1 1/2 cups raw cashews, soaked overnight<br>1/2 – 3/4 cup water<br>3 T plain hummus<br>1 T oil (I used safflower oil)<br>2 T fresh lemon juice<br>2 T apple cider vinegar*<br>1/2 – 2 tsp fine sea salt (3/4 tsp was fine for me)
            </p>

            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Blend drained cashews and water in Vitamix until smooth.  Add the rest of the ingredients and blend until smooth.  Cover and refrigerate until cool.<br><br>*I can&#x27;t stand vinegar.  When I made this the first time, I used the ingredients as they were in the original recipe and made a savory dish.  The vinegar flavor was extremely overpowering to me, and I couldn&#x27;t even eat it.  Next time I will completely omit the vinegar.  Also, if I use the cream for something sweet, perhaps I will use homemade hummus without garlic, as the garlic flavor does come through.
