            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Take 1-2 tablespoons of Raw Apple Cider at the onset of heartburn. It should dissipate almost immediately.<br><br>Taking a digestive enzyme daily can help balance out the environment in your stomach to assist with proper breakdown of food.<br><br>Prepare ginger tea by grating 1 tsp. of fresh ginger and steeping it into a tea ball or strainer and a cup full of hot water.<br><br>Take a half a carrot and juice or blend it and drink.<br><br>In an 8 ounce glass – put in one tablespoon of baking soda. Stir well. Drink the whole glass as fast as you can. (or slow… but not recommended due to taste)<br><br>Not everyone likes the taste of aloe vera juice. Try mixing it with a non-acidic fruit juice, such as apple or grape juice, to improve the taste.
