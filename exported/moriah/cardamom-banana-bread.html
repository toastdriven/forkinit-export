            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Grease a 9x5&quot; loaf pan. Preheat oven to 350*F.<br>Put the butter and grated jaggery into a pan and melt over very low heat. Stir until well mixed with the consistency of melted chocolate, then remove from the heat and leave to cool to one side.<br>Sift together the flour, baking powder, cardamom and salt and leave to one side.<br>In another bowl, add the mashed banana and milk, and whisk in the egg replacer eggs, little by little. Add the jaggery and butter mixture. Whisk again until properly mixed.<br>Gently fold the wet ingredients into the flour mixture until mixed together, then pour the batter into the pan. To decorate, slice the remaining banana lengthwise into 1/4&quot; slices and place over the top of the batter. Bake 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until a skewer comes out clean. Cool before slicing.<br><br>*Jaggery is an unrefined sugar made from the sap of date palms or sugarcane. It has a deep caramel flavor to it, a cross between molasses and fudge, that adds a richness and great color to the bread. Jaggery can be found in cakes or cones at Asian food stores or online, but if you can&#x27;t find it, you can substitute Muscovado sugar.
