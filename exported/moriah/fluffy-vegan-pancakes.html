            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1 C whole wheat flour (I like to use WW pastry flour for a finer texture)<br>1 C unbleached white flour<br>1 T baking powder<br>2 C non-dairy milk<br>1 T vegetable oil
            </p>
        </div>

            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. Stir the flour and baking powder together in a large bowl.  In a separate bowl, combine the milk and oil, and whip for about 1 minute.  Pour the milk mixture into the flour mixture.  Stir just to combine.  Don&#x27;t worry about lumps.<br>2. Lightly oil a medium skillet.  Heat over medium heat.  When a few drops of water sprinkled on the skillet sizzle or bead up, the pan is ready.<br>3. For each pancake, pour 1/2 C of the batter onto the skillet.  Cook until the pancakes begin to bubble, about 3 minutes.  Turn with a spatula and cook until the underside is lightly browned.  Serve with maple syrup.
