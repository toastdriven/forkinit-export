                This is the marvelous hot sauce served in so many Thai restaurants. Similar sauces may be purchased, bottled, and labeled as &quot;all purpose sauce.&quot; Most however are sweet hot and garlicky while lacking the personality of homemade sauce. Saus Prik is the traditional zesty accompaniment to shrimp rolls (Hae Koon,) Thai style fried chicken (Gai Tord,) and cold meats. It is interesting to experiment and find your own application. This recipe will become noticeably spicier with age.<br><br>1 1/2 C seedless golden raisins<br>5 T white vinegar<br>3 T red chili flakes<br>8 cloves garlic<br>1 tsp salt<br>2 fresh red chili peppers seeded and sliced<br>1 C whole canned tomatoes with juice<br>12 oz red plum jam<br>9 oz pineapple juice<br>4 T brown sugar

                Place the first seven ingredients in a food processor or blender and blend to an even consistency. This will take several minutes and requires stopping occasionally to scrape down the sides. Place the remaining ingredients in a saucepan over medium heat. Pour the blended ingredients in the saucepan. While stirring, let the mixture come to a boil. Reduce heat to simmer and cook for 20 more minutes. Store in airtight, sterilized jars. Yields aprox. 3 1/2 cups
