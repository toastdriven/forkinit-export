            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Filling:<br><br>In large bowl, stir together sugar, cornstarch, and salt. Add cherries and mix with spatula or spoon.<br><br>Pie:<br><br>Preheat oven to 425°F. <br><br>In large bowl mix flour and salt. With pastry blender or 2 knives, cut in shortening until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.<br><br>Sprinkle in ice water, 1 Tablespoon at a time, mixing lightly with fork after each addition, until dough is just moist enough to hold together. (the less water you use, the flakier the crust)<br><br>Shape dough into 2 disks with your hands, one slightly larger than the other. Wrap each in plastic wrap and refrigerate 30 minutes.<br><br>On lightly floured surface, with floured rolling pin, roll larger disk as round as you can and wide enough to fill the bottom of your pie dish with some overlap to crimp around the edge. (about 12-inches round) Now the tricky part is scraping the dough off the floured surface you rolled it on. I roll mine on a large board and I use a dough scraper to get the pie dough up off the board and gently curl it over the rolling pin. This makes it easy to carry it to the pie dish without breaking it. (I find this impossible to do with my bare hands) Ease the dough into the pie dish and fix any breaks in it.<br><br>Fill the piecrust. Place 1 tablespoon soy margarine, cut up, around on top.<br><br>Roll remaining disk so it will fit over the top of the pie dish and then some. Ease it onto the pie. Take the dough scraper and trim the dough hanging over the sides of the dish, but leave an inch or so overhang. Fold the overhand toward the dish and mush together to join, crimp between thumb and forefinger making a decorative edge around the pie as you seal the pie crust together.<br><br>Cut 1-inch slits in the top to allow steam to escape during baking — make a nice circular pattern. Put a slight amount of water in your hand and drizzle over the pie, then sprinkle sugar on the wet spots.<br><br>Place pie on cookie sheet to catch any overflow during baking. Bake 20 minutes. Turn oven down to 375°F, bake 1 hour to 1 hour and 10 minutes, until filling bubbles in center. If necessary, cover edges loosely with foil to prevent over-browning during baking. Cool on wire rack at least 1 hour to serve warm, but the longer you cool it the less it will run.
