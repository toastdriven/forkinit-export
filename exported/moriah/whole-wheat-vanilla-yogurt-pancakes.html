            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1 C buttermilk (or 1 T vinegar plus enough non-dairy milk to make one cup total)<br>3/4 C vegan vanilla yogurt, plus more for topping<br>1 T vanilla extract<br>Egg Replacer equal to 2 eggs<br>3 T vegan butter, melted<br>2 C whole wheat flour<br>1 T sugar<br>1 T baking powder<br>1/2 tsp baking soda<br>1/2 tsp salt<br>Pure maple syrup or berries for topping, if desired

            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Add the buttermilk to a medium bowl. If making your own buttermilk, add the vinegar and the milk to the bowl, stir, and let sit for 10 minutes before proceeding.<br>Stir in the yogurt, vanilla extract, eggs, and melted butter. Whisk until well-blended.<br>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.<br>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and stir just until blended.<br>Heat a non-stick griddle or large frying pan over medium heat. Using a 1/3 C measure or a trigger ice cream scoop (my weapon of choice), pour the batter onto the griddle or into the frying pan. They’re ready to flip when they start to look a little dry around the edges, and the pancakes start to form little bubbles, about 1 minute. Flip and cook on the other side until golden brown and the pancake is cooked through.<br>Serve with additional vanilla yogurt and maple syrup drizzled over the top. A sprinkling of blackberries doesn’t hurt, either.
