            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Break your chocolate into pieces - I like to do this with my hands rather than a knife to avoid wasted chocolate shards - and add them to a microwave-safe container with your coconut oil.<br>Microwave for 30-second intervals until your chocolate and oil have melted together. Stir well to ensure that everything is smooth, and let the mixture cool slightly before using; if it&#x27;s super-hot, the shell will partially melt your ice cream. But some people are into that sort of thing.<br>Pour magic shell over a generous scoop of your favorite ice cream.<br>Wait. Be patient! Don&#x27;t touch your spoon until the shell has hardened - it won&#x27;t take more than a minute.<br>Dig in. Crack the shell. Eat every last bite. Preferably near a fan.
