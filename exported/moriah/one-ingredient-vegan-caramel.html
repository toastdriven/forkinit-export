                Bring the apple juice to a boil in a large pan and then simmer it until it turns a dark color and reduces in quantity. This will take anywhere from between 30-60 minutes depending on the size of your pan and how hot the pan heats.  Just be sure to watch it when it’s been on for a while as it can very easily burn.  If you stir it you’ll see how thick it is.  The longer you leave it, the thicker the syrup will become.<br><br>If you want to test this to see whether it’s ready, take a small spoonful out and place it in a bowl until it cools down.  You can now check whether it’s syrupy enough for you.<br><br>Be careful with it when you are pouring it as it’s very hot.  Make sure there are no young children around.<br><br>Pour this into a glass jar or a bowl, cover and store in the fridge.  When you want to use it, you may find it has hardened so you can either leave it at room temperature for a while or you can place the glass jar inside a bowl of boiling water to melt it quickly.<br>How to use caramel<br><br>Now you can use your new syrup in any number of gorgeous ways.  For example you could:<br><br>Add it to your smoothies<br>Top ice cream with it<br>Use it as a dip for fruit<br>Use it as a jam or fruit spread<br>Sweeten cakes, puddings or breads
