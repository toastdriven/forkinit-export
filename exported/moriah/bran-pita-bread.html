            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. In large bowl of electric mixer, dissolve yeast in warm water, about 5 minutes.  Add bran cereal, mixing until combined.  On low speed, beat in 1 C all-purpose flour, salt and oil.  Beat on high speed 3 minutes, scraping sides of bowl.<br>2. Using dough hook on electric mixer or by hand, stir in whole wheat flour.  Continue kneading with mixer on low speed or by hand 5 minutes longer or until dough is smooth and elastic.  Add remaining 1/2 C all-purpose flour, if needed, to make soft dough.<br>3. Divide dough into 12 portions.  Roll each portion between floured hands into a very smooth ball.  Cover with plastic wrap or a damp cloth; let rest 10 minutes.<br>4. On a well-floured surface, lightly roll one piece of dough at a time into 6&quot; round, turning dough over once.  Do not stretch, puncture or crease dough.  Keep unrolled dough covered while rolling each dough piece.  Place 2 rounds of dough at a time on ungreased baking sheet.<br>5. Bake in 450Ã‚Â°F oven about 4 minutes or until dough is puffed and slightly firm.  Turn with a spatula; continue baking about 2 minutes or until lightly browned; cool.  Repeat with remaining dough.  Cut in half and fill.
