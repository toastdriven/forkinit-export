            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. Put Egg Replacer in a 1 C measuring cup and fill with water to the 1 C line.  In a roomy bowl, combine flour and salt.  Cut in shortening.  Add the Egg Replacer/water mix and stir just until incorporated.  Set aside.  In a separate bowl, combine sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg and set aside.<br>2. Preheat oven to 450Ã‚Â°F.  Divide dough in half.  Roll half out to fit a 16 1/2x12 1/2&quot; cookie sheet.  Place rolled-out dough on cookie sheet.  Sprinkle with half the vanilla wafer crumbs.  Spread half the apple slices on top of crumbs.  Sprinkle the rest of the vanilla wafer crumbs on top of the first layer of apple slices.  Top with the rest of the apple slices.  Sprinkle cinnamon/sugar/nutmeg on top of second layer of apple slices.  <br>3. Roll out second half of dough large enough to cover bottom layer of dough and apple filling.  Lightly moisten perimeter of bottom layer of dough with water.  Place second layer of dough on top of bottom layer of dough and apples.  Seal the two layers of dough and crimp.  Make a few small slits in the top crust to let steam escape.  <br>4. Bake at 450Ã‚Â°F for 20 minutes.  The apples will still be slightly firm.  <br>5. Combine the powdered sugar and water to make a glaze.  Pour the glaze over the cake wihile the cake is still warm but NOT hot.
