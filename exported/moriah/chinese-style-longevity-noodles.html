            These noodles are served traditionally at Chinese New Year feasts. Don&#x27;t cut the noodles as you eat them-an ancient Chinese belief holds that long noodles are the key to a long life.

                1. Cook the noodles in boiling, salted water until al dente according to package directions. Drain thoroughly in a colander and rinse them in cold water. Drain them again, lifting each strand to separate and fully drain water from noodles. Set aside.<br>2. In a small bowl, whisk the vegetable stock with the tamari, sesame oil and crushed red pepper. Set aside.<br>3. Warm a wok or skillet over high heat for 30 seconds. Add the peanut oil and swirl to coat the wok. Stir in the ginger and garlic and cook until aromatic, about 15 seconds. Add the cabbage and stir-fry until hot and coated with oil, about 2 minutes. Add the bean sprouts and stir-fry until they are just starting to wilt, about 1 minute. Stir the stock and tamari mixture to recombine, then add it to the wok. Bring to a boil. Add the noodles and stir-fry until they absorb the sauce, about 3 minutes. Adjust seasonings to taste, adding more tamari if desired. Transfer the noodles to a platter and garnish with cilantro and peanuts.
