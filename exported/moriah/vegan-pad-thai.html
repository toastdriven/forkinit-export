            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Sauce:<br><br>In a non-stick pan, combine all ingredients, stirring constantly, over medium heat until peanut butter has melted. Remove from heat and reserve.<br><br>Pad Thai:<br><br>Place rice noodles in large bowl, cover with very hot tap water and soak for 25-30 minutes. Then drain and set aside.<br><br>Cut tofu into wedges and drain for 25-30 minutes. My draining method is to take a kitchen towel and place it on a large cookie sheet. I then place the tofu wedges on the towel in a single layer and then cover the tofu with a double layer of paper towels. Lastly, I place another cookie sheet on top of the paper towel layer and then place 3-4 soup or bean cans on top of the second cookie sheet to add some weight and make the draining process go faster.<br><br>While tofu is draining, prep and measure out the remainder of the ingredients.<br><br>Heat peanut oil in large skillet over medium-high heat. While oil is heating, line a cookie sheet with a triple layer of paper towels.<br><br>Pan fry the tofu wedges in the oil, turning after 4-5 minutes or until a thin crust has formed. Once crust has formed on both sides, place wedges on paper towels to drain. Note: you may have to do more than one batch in order to cook all the tofu.<br><br>Stir fry the peppers, garlic, scallions, bok choy, and ginger until crisp-tender. Add a bit of soy sauce and 1/2 lime’s worth of juice about halfway into the cooking process.<br><br>Once vegetables are cooked, add rice noodles, your reserved sauce, and tofu and stir fry until rice noodles are al dente and tofu is warmed through (about 4-5 minutes)<br><br>Stir in bean sprouts and cilantro, then serve hot. Garnish with crushed peanuts and lime wedges. Add a sprig of cilantro for an even fancier presentation.<br><br>This recipe looks a lot more complex than it really is. My best advice for this dish is to have everything you will need completely ready for use. This is what formal chefs call “mise en place.” Your preparedness is of high value with this dish because once you get cooking, the dish comes together real quick.
