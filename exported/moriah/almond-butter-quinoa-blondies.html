                Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Line an 8&quot; square baking pan with parchment paper (or foil), allowing it to slightly overhang opposite ends. Coat with cooking spray.<br>Beat butter and almond butter in a mixing bowl with an electric mixer until creamy. Beat in egg replacer eggs, brown sugar and vanilla. Whisk quinoa flour, baking powder and salt in a small bowl. Mix the flour mixture into the wet ingredients until just combined. Stir in chocolate chips. Spread the batter evenly into the prepared pan.<br>Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with just a few moist crumbs on it, 25-35 minutes. Do not overbake. Let cool in the pan for 45 minutes. Using the parchment (or foil), lift the whole panful out and transfer to a cutting board. Cut into 24 squares. Let cool completely before storing.
