            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. Preheat oven to 375Ã‚Â°F.<br>2. Lay Kombu in large oven-proof dish.<br>3. Lay veggies on top.<br>4. Sprinkle with tamari or shoyu and the water.<br>5. Bake about one hour and check to see if veggies are tender and water is absorbed.  If there is still water in the pan, put back in oven until water is absorbed.<br>6. While the veggies are cooking take the 1/2 C of balsamic vinegar and boil until it is reduced by half. When the veggies are done, sprinkle the reduced vinegar over the veggies and toss and serve.<br><br>
