            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. Preheat oven to 325Ã‚Â°F.  Line muffin tins with paper cupcake liners.<br>2. Peel carrots, chop off ends and grate finely, which is easiest using a food processor.  Sift flour, Cinnamon, salt, baking soda and baking powder together; set aside.<br>3. In a large mixing bowl, mix Egg Replacer until well blended.  Add sugar, oil, carrots and Pure Vanilla Extract; mix well at medium speed.<br>4. Add flour mixture and nuts or raisins (if desired).  Blend on low speed until just mixed; spoon into cupcake liners, about 3/4 full.<br>5. Place the pans in the preheated oven and bake for 12 minutes.  Switch the pans so the pan from the lower rack is now on the upper rack, and bake for 12 more minutes.  Check for doneness-cupcakes should be browned and springy to the touch.  Let cool completely before frosting.<br>6. To prepare frosting, let cream cheese and butter come to room termperature.  Blend thoroughly with Pure Vanilla Extract, then beat in the powdered sugar at low speed.  Add food coloring if desired; it gives the frosting a nice spreading consistency.  If you don&#x27;t use food coloring, add a drizzle of milk to make the frosting spread more easily, if desired.
