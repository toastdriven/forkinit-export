                Whisk all the dry ingredients together until well combined. Add the rest of the ingredients (except the 1/3 cup of soymilk) and mix well. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. Use batter anytime the next day.<br><br>Once youâ€™re ready to make pancakes, remove the batter from the fridge and stir in up to 1/3 cup of soymilk to thin it if needed/desired. Let the batter sit out on the counter for 20-30 minutes. Heat a non-stick pan over medium heat. Spray with spray oil and wipe out the pan.<br><br>Using a 1/3 cup measure, begin making pancakes.<br>You can add anything you fancy: blueberries, chocolate chips, bananas, strawberries, etc.<br><br>Once the top is bubbly and the edges are set, check to make sure the bottom is brown. Flip.<br><br>Cook on the other side for another few minutes until browned. Stack pancakes in a low oven to keep warm, serve with earth balance margarine and maple syrup.
