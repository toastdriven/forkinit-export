                Topping:<br>In a small saucepan, melt butter over medium heat.  Remove pan from the heat and add the sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt.  Stir with a rubber scraper, pressing when necessary, until smooth.  Add flour and mix until well blended and pasty.  Fold in chopped walnuts; set aside.<br><br>Muffins:<br>Preheat oven to 350Â°F.  In a large bowl, whisk together brown sugar, oil, applesauce, egg replacer and vanilla until smooth.<br>In a separate bowl, sift together flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves and ginger.  Stir oil mixture into flour mixture alternately with buttermilk.  Stir in walnuts.  Fold in apples, mixing until just combined.  Spoon into greased standard-size muffin cups, filling almost full.  Break up the topping mixture with your fingers into medium-sized pieces.  Evenly sprinkle the topping pieces over the muffin batter.  Bake 25-30 minutes or until golden brown and tops spring back when lightly touched.
