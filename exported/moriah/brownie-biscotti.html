            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. Preheat oven to 375Â°F (190Â°C).  Grease baking sheets, or line with parchment paper.<br>2. In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until smooth.  Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla.  Combine the flour, cocoa and baking powder; stir into the creamed mixture until well blended.  Dough will be stiff, so mix in the last bit by hand.  Mix in the chocolate chips and walnuts.<br>3. Divide dough into two equal parts.  Shape into 9x2x1&quot; loaves.  Place onto baking sheet 4 inches apart.  Brush with mixture of water (or milk) and yolk.<br>4. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until firm.  Cool on baking sheet for 30 minutes.<br>5. Using a serrated knife, slice the loaves diagonally into 1&quot; slice.  Return the slices to the baking sheet, placing them on their sides.  Bake for about 5 minutes on each side, or until dry.  Cool completely and store in an airtight container.
