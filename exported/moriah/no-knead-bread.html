            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. Put flour, yeast and salt into a large bowl.  Mix together to distribute ingredients evenly.  Add water and mix until it comes together in a dough.<br>2. Cover dough and leave for about 12 hours at room temperature.<br>3. When ready to make the bread, preheat oven to 500 degrees F.  Put a cast iron, Pyrex or other oven-proof glass pot with a lid into the oven.  Make sure it&#x27;s very hot before putting the dough in it.<br>4. Pour dough out of the bowl onto a floured surface.  Lightly pat it down a little.  Fold the sides into the center to form a ball.<br>5. Sprinkle wheat bran on a clean towel and lay the dough, seam-side-down on the towel.  Sprinkle the top with more wheat bran.<br>6. Invert the dough and put it into the hot pot seam-side-up.  Cover with the lid.<br>7. Bake 30 minutes with the cover closed, and another 15-20 with the cover open.  You want to see caramelization of the crust.
