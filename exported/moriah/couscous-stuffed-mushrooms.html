                Remove mushroom stems; discard or save for another use.  Set caps aside.  In a large nonstick skillet, saute onions and garlic in oil for 1 minute.  Stir in wine (or broth) and soy sauce; add mushroom caps.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 5-6 minutes or until mushrooms are tender.  Remove mushrooms with a slotted spoon, reserving liquid in skillet.  Place mushrooms stem side down on paper towels.<br>In a saucepan, bring broth to a boil.  Stir in couscous.  Remove from the heat; cover and let stand for 5 minutes.  Fluff with fork; add to reserved mushroom liquid.  Cover and cook on low until liquid is absorbed, about 5 minutes.  Add the next five ingredients and toss gently.<br>Sprinkle inside of mushroom caps with salt and pepper.  Stuff with couscous mixture.  Place in an 11-in. x 7-in. x 2-in. baking pan coated with nonstick cooking spray.  Bake at 350Â°F for 15-20 minutes or until stuffing is lightly browned.  Yield:  6 servings
