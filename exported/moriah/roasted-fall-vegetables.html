            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. Preheat oven to 375Â°F.<br>2. Pierce the beets with a fork and toss them in a bowl with about 2 T of olive oil. Season with a generous amount of black pepper and salt. Seal each beet in foil, which helps retain moisture as they cook. (Alternatively, place beets in a baking dish with tight fitting lid.) Set wrapped beets on a cookie sheet or baking tray and place in the oven for about 55 minutes or until very soft when pierced through with a knife. Once cooked, allow beets to cool enough to peel. Cut into quarters, re-season with salt and pepper and a drizzle of olive oil.<br>3. In a baking dish, place the sweet potatoes and butternut squash cubes. Add 2 T of olive oil, and season with salt and pepper. Mix thoroughly until all cubes are well coated with the oil. Place in the oven for about 1 hour or until soft when pierced with a knife, turning the mixture once with a spoon half way through.<br>4. Toss the onions in a bowl with 1 T of olive oil and season generously with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with the brown sugar and scatter thyme leaves over top. Place in a baking dish and cook in oven until very soft and slightly charred, about 50 minutes.<br>5. Arrange all roasted vegetables together on a serving platter.<br><br>Nutrition Info<br>Per Serving (443g-wt.): 360 calories (110 from fat), 12g total fat, 2g saturated fat, 6g protein, 61g total carbohydrate (9g dietary fiber, 19g sugar), 0mg cholesterol, 360mg sodium
