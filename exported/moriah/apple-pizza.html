            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Preheat oven to 450Â°F.<br>Roll out pizza dough onto pizza stone.<br>Spread vegan cream cheese evenly over dough getting it very close to the edge.<br>Spiral the apple slices around the whole pizza, either slightly layering them or laying them side by side, until the entire pizza is covered.<br>Sprinkle streusel topping evenly over the apples.<br>Bake 12-15 minutes, until streusel starts melting.  Enjoy!<br><br>*If you don&#x27;t like vegan cream cheese, this has also worked very well with all-natural apple pie filling as the base.  Follow the recipe as is simply substituting the pie filling for the vegan cream cheese.
