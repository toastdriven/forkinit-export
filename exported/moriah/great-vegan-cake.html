            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1 1/2 C flour<br>1/2 C oil (I use 1/4 plus water)<br>1 C sugar (I like 1/2-3/4 c.)<br>1 1/2 tsp baking soda<br>1/4 tsp salt<br>1 scant C soy/ricemilk/water (water works fine)

            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Bake at 375 for 30 min. in greased pan.<br><br>Note:<br>This is a small recipe.  I&#x27;d double it for 4 servings, triple it if your house likes cake!<br>(I&#x27;ve made 4 versions of this cake in the past two weeks for my house, and each disappeared overnight!)<br><br>Variations:<br>Sweet and Light Lemon Cake:<br>Add 1/4-1/2 C lemon juice instead of the water/ricemilk (that&#x27;s for a double or triple recipe)<br><br>Orange Cake:<br>Add 2 C OJ instead of water and cut back sugar (for a double recipe)<br><br>Torte:<br>Cut 1 or 2 apples into slices and lay them on top. You can sprinkle with cinnamon and/or sugar if you&#x27;d like.<br><br>PLUMS actually work really well like this - cut them in half...you need about 10.<br>(Again, this is for a double or triple recipe.)<br>Be sure to make this in a large round pan for the right look.<br>You may also want to use the full quantity of oil so that it&#x27;s richer (instead of eggs, you know).<br>I can&#x27;t wait to impress my non-veggie friends with this.<br>Who says you can&#x27;t make great vegan cake!!
