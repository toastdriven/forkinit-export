            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. Set aside.<br><br>In a large mixing bowl using an electric hand mixer, beat the dairy-free soy margarine until smooth. Add the packed dark brown sugar and beat until the mixture is fluffy and well combined, about 3-4 minutes. Add the vanilla extract and salt, beating until incorporated.<br><br>Remove the can of coconut milk from the refrigerator. Puncture the top of the can and drain out the liquid. Remove the lid and scoop the semi-solid portion of the coconut into the bowl. Add the confectioners sugar and beat until combined. Add the flour and mix until forming a stiff dough. Fold in the chocolate chips and nuts. Using your hands, shape the dough into 1-inch balls, placing each on the prepared sheet as you work. Place the sheet in the refrigerator for 1-2 hours.<br><br>Melt the dairy-free chocolate in a double boiler or a heatproof dish set over a saucepan of boiling water. (Alternatively, use a microwave safe dish and microwave in 30 second intervals until melted.) Using two forks, dip the cookie dough balls in the melted chocolate, turning to coat and shaking off the excess. Place the truffles on the parchment lined sheet as you work until all of the truffles have been coated. Return to the refrigerator for at least 1 hour or until set. Serve cold.
