            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water with sugar/honey. Let the liquid rest in a warm place for 10 minutes, until frothy and smells yeasty. If the water is too hot (above 120°F) this will kill the yeast. If it is too cold, everything will proceed slowly.<br>Mix in pumpkin, Egg Replacer eggs, oil, salt and spices. Slowly add the flour until it all comes together. The dough should still be soft and slightly sticky to the touch.<br>Sprinkle flour onto a clean work surface and knead the dough, folding in loose flour so that the dough is elastic but does not stick to your hands or the counter. Knead with vigor for 10 minutes.<br>Grease a large bowl with vegetable oil. Place the dough in the bowl and cover with a moist tea towel or with plastic wrap to keep in moisture. Let the dough rise in a warm place for 1 1/2-2 hours until it doubles in volume.<br>Press down the dough, releasing the air from it. Shape it into a dragon. This can be done either in one large loaf or with smaller loaves that can then be joined together. Make sure to exaggerate any shapes, as the rising dough will tend to lose its definition. Keep in mind that thinner parts will cook more quickly in the oven.<br>Bake in a preheated oven at 375°F for 30-40 minutes, or until golden brown. The underside will give a hollow, wooden sound when tapped with a finger.<br>Let the dragon cool and decorate as a centerpiece.
