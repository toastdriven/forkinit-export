            These light, delicate cookies are a family favorite.  You can decorate them with pecan halves or candied cherry halves, but leave some plain for the kids.

                1/2 C butter (vegan)<br>2/3 C sugar<br>1 egg (or Egg Replacer)<br>1 tsp Pure Vanilla Extract<br>3/4 C all-purpose flour<br>1/4 tsp salt<br>1/4 tsp baking powder<br>Pecan halves or candied cherry halves, optional

            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. Preheat oven to 350Ã‚Â°F.<br>2. Cream butter, sugar, and Vanilla together.  Add the egg and beat until the batter is light and fluffy.<br>3. Gently mix in the flour, salt and baking powder to make a soft dough.<br>4. Drop by the scant (barely full) tsp, 2&quot; apart, on ungreased cookie sheets.<br>5. Bake for about 8 minutes.  Use a thin, flexible spatula to remove the cookies from the pans, as they do not rise much and can be a tad difficult to remove from the pan.  Using parchment paper or a cookie sheet that has no rim makes it easier.  Remove the cookies right away or they will stick.<br>6. Top with pecan halves or candied cherries immediately after removing the cookies from the pan.
