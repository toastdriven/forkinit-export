            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Heat 1/2 C annatto oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the flour and chili powder and cook until fully incorporated. Slowly stir in the tomato sauce, water, cumin and garlic until smooth and the sauce thickens. Season with salt and pepper to taste.<br>Preheat oven to 350°F. Heat 2-3 T annatto oil in a skillet and briefly fry all the corn tortillas individually until softened, flipping after a minute. Add more annatto oil if needed. Transfer to a plate to use for layering.<br>Pour 1/3 C of enchilada sauce into the bottom of a 9x13&quot; casserole dish so that the tortillas don&#x27;t burn or stick to the bottom. Add a layer of 4 corn tortillas. Spread the filling on top of the tortillas. Top with cheese and more enchilada sauce and continue to layer until you almost reach the top of the pan. Depending on your technique and desires, you might end up with three layers (12 tortillas) or four (16 tortillas). The top layer should be cheese. Bake at 350°F until the cheese is melted and bubbly, about 30 minutes. The filled pan can also be covered with plastic wrap and put in the fridge for up to a day if you wish to do the prep ahead of time. Then it will need at least an our in the oven.<br>Let sit for 10-15 minutes and serve!<br>*To make annatto oil: Combine 2 C of corn oil with 1/4 C annatto seeds in a saucepan. Simmer over low heat until the oil is a rich red; 10 minutes should do it. Don&#x27;t use too high a heat or simmer too long or the seeds blacken and the oil loses its color. Strain out and discard the seeds. If you&#x27;re not going to use the oil right away, store in the refrigerator.
