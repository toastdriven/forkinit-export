            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1/2 C organic chocolate soy milk (for this recipe I like to use Vitasoy Rich Chocolate Soy Milk)<br>9 or 10 oz bag of semisweet vegan chocolate chips (I&#x27;ve had good success with Tropical Source or Sunspire Brand all-natural brands, NOT carob chips)<br>12 oz silken tofu<br>1/4 C Amaretto or almond-flavored liquor<br>1/4 tsp natural pure almond extract (I use the Flavorganics Almond Extract for this recipe)
            </p>

            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. Pour the chocolate milk into a small pot and bring to a simmer. Remove the milk from heat and let cool a bit while you melt down the chocolate chips. You can melt the chocolate chips in a double boiler or if you are like me, and don&#x27;t own a double-boiler, you can cobble one together using a tiny saucepan set under a larger mixing bowl. Fill the tiny saucepan with an inch or two of water and bring barely to a simmer - place the big mixing bowl with the chocolate chips on top of the tiny saucepan and let the heat come up and gently warm the chips while you stir occasionally until completely melted. Remove from heat.<br>2. Add the soy milk and silken tofu to the melted chocolate chips. Process with a hand or regular blender until completely smooth. Stir in the Amaretto and almond extract. Taste and adjust for flavor, adding a bit more extract if needed.<br>3. Chill in the big bowl (or in individual bowls) for at least 1 1/2 hours, the longer the better. The pudding will set up nicely as it cools.
