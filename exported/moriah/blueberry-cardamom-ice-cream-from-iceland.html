                2 C blueberries<br>1 T water<br>2/3 C sugar<br>1/4-1/2 tsp freshly ground cardamom, or, as the original recipe calls for, you can crush cardamom seeds (each pod holds 1/8-1/4 tsp seeds once crushed)<br>2 C coconut milk solids (at the top of the can)<br>1 C non-dairy milk

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                In a medium saucepan, stir and simmer together the blueberries, water, sugar and cardamom until the blueberries soften and the sugar dissolves - about 5-10 minutes.  Chill completely in an ice bath or overnight.<br><br>When the blueberry mix is sufficiently chilled, give them a buzz-whir with an immersion blender (or regular blender).  You can keep a small scoop unblended for texture, if you&#x27;d like.  Just keep in mind that large pieces of blueberry will freeze very hard in the ice cream.<br><br>Add the blueberry mixture to an ice cream maker with the coconut milk solids and milk.  Churn according to the manufacturer&#x27;s instructions.  Eat immediately for soft serve or put in a container and freeze a few hours longer for a harder freeze.
