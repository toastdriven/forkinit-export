                Preheat oven to 400Â°F.  In a large mixing bowl, mix the vegetables, salt and pepper with enough olive oil to coat.  In a separate bowl, mix together the brown sugar, cinnamon, cardamom and star anise.  Put the vegetables in a roasting pan and bake for 25 minutes.  Add the spice and sugar mixture to the vegetables, stir well and continue to roast another 10 to 15 minutes until the vegetables are tender.  Melt the butter in a small pan and cook over medium-low heat until it begins to brown.  Stir in the fresh thyme and pour over the cooked vegetables.  Serve immediately.
