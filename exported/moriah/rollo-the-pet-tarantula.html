            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. Combine sesame seeds, sunflower seeds, and the 1 C (240 ml) pecan pieces in a food processor and process to a coarse meal, leaving a little texture remaining. Transfer to a bowl.<br>2. In 3 separate batches, add the dried peaches, dates, vanilla extract, water and 1/3 of the ground nut mixture to the processor, and process until dried fruits and nuts are well incorporated and fruits almost form a paste. Stop the machine as often as needed to scrape down sides and redistribute ingredients. 3. Transfer to a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 3 hours or overnight to firm up the mixture for easier handling.<br>4. Prepare platter by covering it with orange paper or an orange napkin. Wrap the dish completely with clear plastic wrap. Put the confection mixture on the platter. Then, using the hands, form mixture into a giant tarantula. Decorate plate with plastic spiders or ants, and invite guests to break off pieces to nibble.<br><br>VARIATION 1: As an alternative to making the tarantula, divide mixture into thirds, place each third onto an 18-inch (45 cm) long piece of waxed paper. Lightly oil hands. Form into 3 logs. Spread 2 C (480 ml) broken pecans pieces out onto a large baking pan, then roll the fruit roll into the nuts. Firm up in refrigerator. Cut into 1/2-inch (1 cm) slices and arrange on a serving platter.<br><br>VARIATION 2: To make confection balls, lightly oil hands, and roll about 1 teaspoon of the fruit mixture at a time into balls; then roll them into 2 C (240 ml) coarsely broken pecan pieces, pressing them onto the surface. Arrange on an attractive serving dish, and garnish with a large citrus leaf or two and a small bunch of grapes. Makes about 50 confections.
