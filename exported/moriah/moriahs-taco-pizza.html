            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. Make the cornmeal pizza crusts following the instructions in the recipe.<br>2. Preheat the oven to 450Ã‚Â°F.<br>3. When pizza crust is ready, evenly spread one can of refried beans on each pizza.  If beans are hard to spread, warming them in the microwave or oven for a few minutes will help soften them up.<br>4. Spread a thin layer of taco sauce on top of the refried beans.  (Pouring it on too thick will cause the toppings to be watery.)  Putting it on top of the beans will keep the crust from becoming soggy.<br>5. Sprinkle the diced onion and sliced olives onto each pizza.<br>6. Sprinkle cheese onto each pizza.<br>7. Bake approximately 25 minutes, switching places in the oven halfway through for more even baking.  Baking time may vary.<br>8. When pizzas are done, slice into wedges and garnish with avocado, chili peppers, taco seasoning, garlic and cilantro. <br>9. !Buen provecho!  :)
