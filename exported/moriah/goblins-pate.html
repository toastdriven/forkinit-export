            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. Soak nuts and seeds in plenty of water to cover for about 10 to 12 hours. The sunflower skins become loosened and float in the water. Rinse and remove as many of them as possible by rubbing the seeds between the hands and using a fine strainer to scoop the skins as they float to the top.<br>2. Put soaked nuts and seeds in the food processor. Add garlic, carrots, onion, chile, salt, paprika, lemon juice, Bragg Aminos, and bread cubes. Process at least a full minute or two to create a fine textured pate.<br>3. Spoon mixture into a lettuce-lined plate, and form the shape of a pumpkin with the hands. Cut the cucumber in half and place it in the center to form the stem. With the fingers, form indentations to imitate the corrugations of some pumpkins and decorate with strips of thinly cut cucumber.<br>4. Arrange watercress around the base and toss a few plastic spiders onto the pate. Serves 25 along with other appetizers.
