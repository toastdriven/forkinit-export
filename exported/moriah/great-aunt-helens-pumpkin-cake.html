            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. Preheat oven to 350Â°F.<br>2. In a large bowl, beat egg replacer.  Add sugar, pumpkin, oil, Pumpkin Pie Spice (or Cinnamon) and Vanilla; beat until well blended.  Add the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and nuts; mix gently to combine.<br>3. Pour into an ungreased 9x13&quot; pan; bake for 30-40 minutes, until the cake is golden brown.  It should be pulling away from the sides of the pan a bit, and will spring back when lightly pressed.  Remove from oven and let cool at least an hour before frosting.<br>4. To prepare frosting:  Beat cream cheese and butter with powdered sugar and Pure Vanilla Extract until well blended and fluffy.  Add a bit more powdered sugar if a stiffer frosting is desired.  Spoon the frosting onto the center of the cake and spread toward the edges until the cake is evenly frosted.  If you want to be really decadent, the frosting recipe can be doubled for extra thick icing, a real kid pleaser.
