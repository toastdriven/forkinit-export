            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. In a large bowl, sift or whisk together the flour, salt, baking soda, and spices.  Set aside.<br>2. In the bowl of your electric mixer, with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy.  Add the egg (replacer) and molasses and beat until well combined.  Note:  To prevent the molasses from sticking to the measuring cup, first spray the cup with a non stick vegetable spray (like Pam).  Gradually add the flour mixture beating until incorporated.<br>3. Divide the dough in half, and wrap each half in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least two hours or overnight. <br>4. Preheat oven to 350Ã‚Â°F (177Ã‚Â°C) and place rack in center of oven.  Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside while you roll out the dough.<br>5. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to a thickness of about 1/8&quot; - 1/4&quot;.  Use a gingerbread cutter to cut out the cookies.  With an offset spatula lift the cut out cookies onto the baking sheet, placing the cookies about 1&quot; (2.54 cm) apart.  If you are hanging the cookies or using as gift tags, make a hole at the top of the cookies with a straw or end of a wooden skewer.<br>6. Bake for about 8 - 12 minutes depending on the size of the cookies.  Small ones will take about 8 minutes, larger cookies will take about 12 minutes.  They are done when they are firm and the edges are just beginning to brown. <br>7. Remove the cookies from the oven and cool on the baking sheet for about 1 minute.  When they are firm enough to move, transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.<br>8. If desired, you can press raisins, currants, or candies into the dough for eyes and buttons while the cookies are still warm.  Otherwise, royal icing can be used to decorate the cookies.  You can also use the royal icing as a glue to attach candies, raisins, and sprinkles.<br><br>Makes about 3 dozen cookies depending on the size of cookie cutter used.<br>Store in an airtight container for several weeks.
