            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 375Â°F.  Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.  Place 1/2 C sugar for dipping in 8&quot; or 9&quot; cake pan.<br>2. Whisk flour, baking soda, spices and salt in medium bowl until thoroughly combined; set aside.<br>3. In standing mixer fitted with paddle attachment, beat butter with brown and granulated sugars at medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.  Reduce speed to medium-low and add egg replacer and vanilla; increase speed to medium and beat until incorporated, about 20 seconds.  Reduce speed to medium-low and add molasses; beat until fully incorporated, about 20 seconds, scraping bottom and sides of bowl once with rubber spatula.  Reduce speed to lowest setting; add flour mixture and beat until just incorporated, about 30 seconds, scraping bowl down once.  Give dough final stir with rubber spatula to ensure that no pockets of flour remain at bottom.  Dough will be soft.<br>4. Using tablespoon measure, scoop heaping T of dough and roll between palms into 1 1/2&quot; ball; drop ball into cake pan with sugar and repeat to form about 4 balls.  Toss balls in sugar to coat and set on prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2&quot; apart.  Repeat with remaining dough.  Bake 1 sheet at a time until cookies are browned, still puffy, and edges have begun to set but centers are still soft (cookies will look raw between cracks and seem underdone), about 11 minutes, rotating baking sheet halfway through baking.  Do not overbake.<br>5. Cool cookies on baking sheet 5 minutes, then use wide metal spatula to transfer cookies to wire rack; cool cookies to room temperature and serve.  (Can be stored at room temperature in airtight container or zipper-lock plastic bag up to 5 days.)
