            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Place rice, water, tomatoes, chilies and corn into rice cooker, in that order in layers. Do not stir (make sure rice is at bottom with water). Set to cook.<br>Once rice cooker is done cooking, open lid and using a fork, carefully fluff up rice. Drizzle olive oil over rice and season well with salt and pepper. Taste and adjust for seasoning. Add in handful of chopped cilantro, stir and serve. <br><br>Notes:<br>If you don&#x27;t have a rice cooker, prepare your rice in a pot on your stove top as directed, adding in the additional ingredients just like in these directions. They will all cook up together the same way.
