            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Take your favorite vegan cookie dough (shortbread works well for this, peanut butter might work too), and roll each portion of dough into a log the same size and shape as a finger. Press a sliced almond onto the tip of each one, to make a finger nail. You may require some red icing to &quot;glue&quot; the almond down. Use a toothpick to draw creases where the knuckle would be. Bake the cookies as per recipe directions. Once done, you can go even nuttier with the icing if you like, drawing on stitches, wounds, gobs of blood, etc.
