                For the Sage Sauce: <br>1. In a small saucepan, melt the Earth Balance over medium heat. Continue to cook, stirring constantly, until golden brown. <br>2. Remove from the heat and stir in the sage, the sea salt, and the black pepper. Set aside. <br><br>For the Gnocchi:<br>Cook the potatoes in boiling, salted water for 15 to 20 minutes, or until tender. <br>1. Stir in a generous amount of the sea salt, drain, and mash until smooth. Transfer to a bowl. <br>2. Sprinkle flour into the bowl with one hand while kneading into the potatoes with the other hand. <br>3. Continue until all the flour is worked in and the dough is smooth. This will take a few minutes (the dough will be sticky at first). Divide into 3 pieces. <br>4. Form each piece into a 1- to 2&quot;-thick roll. Cut into 1&quot;-long pieces and roll against a fork. Repeat with the remaining dough. <br>5. Drop each gnocchi into heavily salted, boiling water. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until rising to the surface. <br>6. Remove from the water, drain well, and transfer to a warm plate. <br>7. Toss with the Sage Sauce and garnish with the sage leaves.<br>Makes 6 to 8 servings
