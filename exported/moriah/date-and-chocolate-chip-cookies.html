                2 1/4 C all-purpose flour (I use whole wheat pastry flour)<br>1 tsp baking soda<br>1 tsp salt<br>1 C vegan buttersticks, softened<br>3/4 C sugar<br>3/4 C brown sugar<br>2 chia eggs (2 T ground chia seeds + 6 T water)<br>1 tsp vanilla<br>2 C semisweet chocolate chips<br>1 C dried dates, chopped

            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Preheat oven to 375Â°F.<br>Combine ground chia seeds with water and let sit 5-10 minutes, until thickened.<br>In a bowl, combine flour, baking soda and salt. Set aside.<br>In a second larger bowl, mash the butter, sugar and brown sugar together until the butter has soaked up the sugar.<br>Mix the chia eggs and vanilla into the butter/sugar until the mixture is smooth.<br>Little by little, add the flour mixture to the butter mixture until everything is mixed together. The batter should be gooey.<br>Stir in chips and dates.<br>Drop round teaspoonfuls of batter onto ungreased cookie sheets. The cookies will flatten and spread out as they bake. You should have enough for about 80 cookies.<br>Bake 8 to 10 minutes or until golden brown. Let them cool, and then enjoy!
