            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Heat the non-dairy milk, 1/2 C sugar, salt and margarine in a small saucepan over low heat until the margarine is just melted. Remove from heat and add vanilla; set aside to cool until warm to the touch.<br>While margarine mixture is cooling, place the warm water, 1 T sugar and yeast in a 1 C glass measuring cup. Stir for a couple seconds and then set aside for 10 minutes. The yeast will double in size and should reach the 3/4 C line. If it doesn&#x27;t, either the yeast was dead or the water was not the correct temperature - you will need to try again before continuing on to the next step.<br>In a stand mixer with the whisk attachment, combine margarine mixture with the yeast and beat at medium speed for 2 minutes. Reduce to low speed and add 2 1/2 C flour. Mix for about 2 minutes and then add 2 more C of flour. Beat for 1 more minute. Remove dough from mixing bowl and place on a lightly floured surface. The dough will be a little wet and sticky - knead about 2 minutes with your hands.<br>Place dough in a large bowl sprayed with cooking spray and roll around dough so it is covered in spray (this will keep it from sticking to the bowl while it rises). Cover with plastic wrap and set aside in a warm place until it has doubled in size - about 1 1/2 hours.<br>Once risen, punch in the center so that the dough deflates. Take dough out of bowl and place on a floured surface to let rest an additional 10 minutes.<br>Preheat oven to 350°F. Spray a 12-C bundt pan with cooking spray.<br>Combine granulated sugar, brown sugar and cinnamon in a shallow dish. In another shallow dish, whisk together the melted margarine and non-dairy milk.<br>Divide dough into 4 equal portions. Working with one portion at a time (cover remaining dough to prevent drying), gently roll and stretch the dough into a long rope with about a 1&quot; diameter. Cut each rope into 1&quot; portions, shaping each piece into small balls (you should have approximately 10-12 pieces per rope).<br>Dip each ball into the melted margarine mixture and then roll in the cinnamon sugar mixture. Layer balls in bundt pan. If you have any extra sugar at the end, sprinkle over top. Bake for 25 minutes or until lightly golden. Cool 5 minutes on rack. Serve either directly from the bundt pan or place a plate on top of the bundt pan and carefully invert onto the plate to serve.
