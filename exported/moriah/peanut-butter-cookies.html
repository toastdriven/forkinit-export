                2 C whole wheat pastry flour, spelt flour, or unbleached all-purpose flour<br>1 tsp baking soda<br>3/4 tsp fine grain sea salt<br>1 C organic, chunky natural peanut butter<br>1 C maple syrup<br>1/3 C extra virgin olive oil<br>1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. Preheat oven to 350F degrees. Place racks in the top third.<br>2. In a medium mixing bowl combine the flour, baking soda, and salt. in a separate larger bowl combine the peanut butter, maple syrup, olive oil, and vanilla. Stir until combined. Pour the flour mixture over the peanut butter mixture and stir until barely combined - still a bit dusty looking. Let sit for five minutes, give one more quick stir, just a stroke or two. Now drop by heaping tablespoonfuls onto parchment-lined baking sheets. Press down on each one gently with the back of a fork. It&#x27;s a loose batter, so if you&#x27;re set on doing criss-crosses, go ahead and chill the batter for an hour or so before this step. Bake for 10, maybe 11 minutes - but don&#x27;t over bake or they will be dry. Let cool five minutes and transfer to a cooling rack.<br><br>H.S. note:  Spelt flour bakes into a slightly darker cookie (photo), whole wheat pastry flour is slightly blonder - more traditional in appearance in the end. Finish the cookies with chopped nuts or a sprinkling of flaky salt. I&#x27;d also recommend seeking out a peanut butter that is well combined, and not super-oily (extra slick) looking - to avoid problems with the cookie batter.
