            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Lightly oil a pie plate with coconut or another oil.<br>Prepare the crust: Place all the crust ingredients in a food processor and pulse briefly until crumbly and the mixture will hold together when pressed with your fingers.<br>Transfer the mixture to the prepared pie plate, pressing it evenly into the pan.<br>Prepare the filling: Place all the filling ingredients, except the lemon zest (and starting with 3 tablespoons of the agave nectar), in a high-powered blender. Puree for a minute or so at medium-high speed until completely smooth and no texture of the cashews remains.<br>Taste, and add the remaining tablespoon of agave, if needed, to sweeten, and puree again.<br>Once smooth, stir in the lemon zest.<br>Pour the filling into the crust, then cover with aluminum foil or plastic wrap and place the pie in the freezer for at least 5 to 6 hours to set. After this time, the pie will be partially set, but can be sliced. You can freeze it longer, and remove the pie about 20 minutes before serving, to slice easily.<br><br><br>Note: It is preferable to use unsoaked cashews because they have less moisture, and then can absorb some of the moisture from the strawberries as the pie sets. If using local seasonal berries, they tend to be softer and juicier than imported. Opt for another 2 tablespoons of cashews to help absorb the extra juices.
