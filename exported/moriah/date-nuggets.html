            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                In a food processor, blend the banana chips into coarse pieces.  Pour into a medium mixing bowl.  Blend the macadamia nuts in the food processor until they are small pieces, but not completely ground up, then add those to the mixing bowl.  Blend the dates in the food processor until it comes together in a ball.  Scoop into the mixing bowl.<br>Add the remaining ingredients, except for the extra oat flour used for rolling.  Mix the ingredients together by hand until well combined.  It should be a thick mixture and only sticky enough to hold together well when formed into small balls.<br>Using a small or medium cookie scoop, scoop approximately 1 T of the mixture at a time and roll into a ball.  Set the balls on a plate or cookie sheet.<br>Put about 1/4 C oat flour in a shallow dish.  Roll each ball in the flour until completely coated.  Tap excess flour off by tapping the ball against the side of the dish.  There should only be a thin layer of oat flour left on the outside, enough to prevent the balls from sticking to each other.<br>Enjoy at room temperature, or refrigerate for a few hours or overnight until cold.
