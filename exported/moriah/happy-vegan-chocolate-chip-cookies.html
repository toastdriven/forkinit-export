            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                VERY IMPORTANT - make sure all ingredients are at room temperature.  It will work if they&#x27;re not at room temp but it works MUCH better if they are.  Also, while your oven is preheating, put the cookie sheets you&#x27;re going to use on top of the oven so they get preheated as well.<br><br>1. Preheat oven to 350Ã‚Â°F.<br>2. In a large bowl, mix flour, baking powder, salt and cinnamon (if you choose).  Add chips.  Make a well in the center and set aside.<br>3. In a medium bowl, mix vegan sugar and oil.  Mix well.  Add the vanilla and then the water.  Mix well.  Add the wet ingredients to the well in the dry.  Mix well but be careful not to overwork it.  Add more chips if you need to.  Spoon onto ungreased cookie sheets.  Bake for 5 minutes and then flip and rotate the sheets.  Bake another 4 minutes and check them.<br>4. The cookies are done when they seem a little bit softer than you want them to be.  They will harden up some as they cool.
