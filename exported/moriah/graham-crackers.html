            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. Mix the all the dry ingredients together. Cream together Earth Balance and sugar. Add vanilla and agave and beat with a whisk until smooth. Add a little of the flour and a little of the water to the earth balance/sugar mixture and combine. Continue adding in flour and water, a little at a time, until all flour and water is added. Work the dough with your hands until everything is evenly combined.<br>2. Divide dough in half and cover. Let rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.<br>3. Preheat oven to 325ยบ F. Roll out the dough into a rectangle that measures approximately 11?x15?. Trim edges. Using a knife or a pizza cutter, cut the dough into squares or rectangles (I cut mine into 3&quot;x3&quot; squares). Prick the squares with a fork.<br>4. Bake for 30-40 minutes at 325ยบ F or until the crackers are turning golden brown around the edges. You can sprinkle cinnamon and sugar on top of the crackers during the last 10 minutes of baking if you like.<br>5. Remove from the baking sheet and let cool on a wire rack.
