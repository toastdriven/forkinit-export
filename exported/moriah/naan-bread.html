            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. Put the sugar, yeast and water in a small bowl and mix until the yeast is dissolved. Let stand until it gets foamy, about 10 minutes.<br>2. Put the flour in a big bowl. Make a well in the center and add the 1 T of oil, the salt and the yeast mixture. Mix thoroughly with your hands to form a dough. Add sprinkles of water if needed.<br>3. Turn the dough onto a floiured surface and knead for 5 minutes, until dough is smooth.<br>4. Return the dough to the bowl, cover with saran wrap and let rise in a warm place for 1 1/2 hours. It will double in size.<br>5. When you are ready to bake the bread preheat the oven to broil. <br>6. Turn the dough onto a floured surface and knead for 2 minutes. Break off small balls and pat into rounds about 5 inches in diameter and 1/2 inch thick.<br>7. Cover a baking sheet with tin foil and grease it well. Place 4 dough rounds on the tin foil and brush the surfaces with oil. Bake for 3 minutes. Remove and turn breads over, brushing with more oil. Return to oven and bake 3 more minutes. Remove and brush with oil again. Return to oven again for an additional 2 minutes, being careful that they don&#x27;t burn. Wrap in tin foil until you are ready to serve. Repeat with remaining dough.
