                1. Make the batter as directed in the basic cake recipe.  Line two muffin tins (1/2 C size) with paper liners.  Fill cups 3/4 full (you may have a little batter left).  Bake cupcakes 15 to 18 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.  Cool in pan on a rack for 2 minutes.  Then turn the cupcakes out on a rack to cool completely before frosting (at this point, cupcakes can be frozen for 2 to 3 weeks).<br>2. Beat peanut butter and butter until smooth, either in a large bowl or using an electric mixer.  Add the cream and sugar and beat until creamy.  Then, frost the cupcakes, and, with your fingertip, scoop out a small amount of the frosting from the center of the cake.<br>3. Place the jelly in a glass dish and heat in a microwave approximately 1 minute until softened.  Place 1/2 tsp of jelly in the center of each cupcake.
