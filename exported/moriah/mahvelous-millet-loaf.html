            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. Oil a large loaf pan or mist it with nonstick cooking spray.  Set aside.<br>2. Rinse the millet well and place it in a large saucepan along with the water, onions, carrots, celery, salt, garlic and thyme.  Bring to a boil.<br>3. Cover and reduce the heat to medium-low.  Simmer for 30 minutes.<br>4. Remove from the heat and let stand 10 minutes.  Stir in the oil and nuts or seeds and mix well.  Spoon the mixture into the prepared loaf pan, packing it down firmly.  Place on a cooling rack and allow the loaf to rest in the pan at room temperature for 15 minutes.  Carefully turn the loaf out of the pan onto a cutting board or serving platter.  Cut into slices and serve.<br><br>Tip:  To toast the walnuts, cashews or sunflower seeds, place them in a small dry skillet over medium heat.  Stir constantly until golden brown and fragrant.
