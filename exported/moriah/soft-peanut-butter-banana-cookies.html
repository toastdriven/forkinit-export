            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Mix wet and dry ingredients in separate containers. Combine and mix until just blended. Don&#x27;t over mix as this affects the proteins in the flour and can make the cookies overly chewy. Make balls of dough approx. 1 inch diameter and place on a lightly greased or non-stick cookie sheet. Silicon sheets work great! Make little fork marks in them and add toppings, if you&#x27;d like. Bake at 350F until lightly browned on the edges. I don&#x27;t like to list bake times because ovens are so varied, but check them after 7 minutes or so.<br><br>Try these tasty adornments:<br>add chocolate chips, the texture of these cookies is perfect for them!<br>or drizzle chocolate on top after the cookies have cooled<br>roll the balls of dough in sugar<br>put some shredded coconut on top<br>These went fast, especially the coconut ones!!! Enjoy.
