                Combine the orange juice, olive oil, garlic, parsley, basil, salt and pepper and mix well. Pour marinade over sliced squash and allow to stand for 1/2 hour. Place squash on medium-hot grill and cook for about 3 minutes before turning. Turn to uncooked side and grill for another 2 to 3 minutes or until done to your liking. Remove from the grill and serve immediately.<br><br>Squash is best served when tender but still crisp. Remove it from the grill with the thought in mind that it will continue to cook until served.
