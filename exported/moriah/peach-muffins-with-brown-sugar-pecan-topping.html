            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. Preheat the oven to 400Ã‚Â°F.  Line 12 standard muffin cups with paper baking cups.<br>2. For the muffins, combine flour, brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl.  Add peaches to flour mixture and toss to coat well.  If peaches have released juices, drain juices before adding peaches to flour.<br>3. In separate bowl, whisk egg with yogurt and melted butter to combine.  Add egg mixture to flour-peach mixture and stir until just combined.  Do not overbeat.  Spoon batter into muffin cups.<br>3. For the topping, stir flour and brown sugar together in a small bowl.  Cut in butter using a pastry blender or two knives.  Stir in pecans.  Sprinkle topping evenly over batter.<br>4. Bake 20 to 25 minutes, rotating pan halfway through, until tops of muffins are lightly browned and puffed and a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out mostly clean of crumbs.  Let muffins cool in pan on a cooling rack for 5 minutes.  Remove muffins from the tin and cool 5 to 10 minutes more.  Serve warm or at room temperature.
