                Substitutions: make this dish in one large pie if desired. You may also use an all-natural pie crust instead of the puff pastry.<br><br>1. Soak lentils in water to cover for 2 to 3 hours. (Soaking the lentils make them more easily digestible. You may skip the soaking step and simply cook the lentils for an extra 15 to 30 minutes, until tender.)<br>2. Drain and place in a saucepan with 3 C water and the bay leaf. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook, uncovered, until the lentils are tender but still hold a little texture, about 30 minutes.<br>3. Preheat oven to 375Â°F.<br>4. Heat the oil over medium heat. SautÃ© the shallots, carrot and parsnip with salt and pepper. Cook stirring frequently until the vegetables are browned, about 7 to 8 minutes. Add the garlic and chopped tomato. Stir well. Add the wine. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat and simmer, covered, for an additional 5 minutes.<br>5. Stir the lentils and their remaining cooking broth into the vegetables. Simmer over medium-low, uncovered, until the sauce has thickened, about 10 to 15 minutes. Adjust seasonings to taste.<br>6. Pour the lentils into individual ramekins or into one deep pie dish. Roll defrosted puff pastry dough to 1/8&quot; thickness. Cut to size just slightly larger than the top of your dish. Place the dough over the lentils, and make a few slashes over the top to allow steam to escape. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until golden brown and piping hot.<br><br>Nutrition Info<br>Per Serving (181g-wt.): 400 calories (130 from fat), 14g total fat, 3.5g saturated fat, 14g protein, 50g total carbohydrate (9g dietary fiber, 5g sugar), 0mg cholesterol, 310mg sodium
