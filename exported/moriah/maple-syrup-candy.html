            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Collect a bowl of clean snow from outside, and put it in your freezer while you work.<br>Then, combine the syrup and butter in a saucepan with high sides. Stirring constantly, heat the mixture to 220 degrees F. The syrup will be a molten, sticky mess, so this is definitely a step for grown-ups to do.<br>Once it’s hot enough, turn off the heat and let the mixture rest for about a minute. Then, remove your snow from the freezer and drizzle the syrup out into long ribbons. As soon as you see a skin start to form on top of the syrup, it’s cool enough to carefully peel out of the snow.<br>This recipe makes enough for everyone to try a bite and then some. If you end up with leftovers, they can be kept in the fridge for at least a few weeks. They’ll stick together, but that didn’t stop anyone at our house from enjoying them for an entire snowstorm.
