            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Place the mushrooms in the Bragg’s and olive oil and store in an airtight container overnight.<br>Grind the nuts, salt, thyme, sage, and onion powder in a food processor till very processed: it should be starting to look like a coarse nut butter. Add the pepper, lemon, dates, and Bragg’s. Process again till the mixture is even. Set aside in a mixing bowl.<br>Remove the mushrooms from the marinade, reserving a few tablespoons of it. Put the mushrooms, celery, and tomatoes in the food processor (no need to wash after you remove the nuts!), and process till the mixture is finely chopped.<br>Add the mushroom/celery/tomato mixture to the nut mixture, throw in the parsley, and knead well with your hands, just as you would mix regular meatloaf!<br>When it’s all well mixed, place into a small loaf pan (I used one that was about 5-3/4″ x 3″ x 2-1/8″). Place in a dehydrator at 115 degrees for eight hours (you can also place in an oven at 150 with the door slightly ajar).<br>When the loaf is done, slice into twelve slices. Serve with a large kale salad.
