            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Mix everything in a bowl with a fork, then use margarine on your hands to form the dough into a ball. Put a clean towel on top of the bowl and put the bowl in a warm place to rise for at least an hour.<br>Get a large deep frying pan and put it on medium high to melt cooking oil until hot and ready to fry. After the dough is done rising, take small pieces of bread dough, make a shape almost like a doughnut and put a small piece in the middle. Then put it in the hot frying pan until one side is between golden and light brown. Then flip the other side over until the same color.
