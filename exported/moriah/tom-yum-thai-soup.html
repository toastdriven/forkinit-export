            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. Pour stock into a deep cooking pot.<br>2. Place lemongrass slices in a food processor and process until finely grated, or pound by hand with a pestle &amp; mortar and add to the broth.<br>3. Add garlic, chilies (including whole chilies, if using) and lime leaves to broth. Bring to a boil and continue cooking for 5 minutes, or until broth is fragrant.<br>4. Add the noodles and stir until broken apart. Turn heat down to medium-high.<br>5. Add tofu, mushrooms, bell peppers. Cook for 5-8 minutes, or until noodles are done.<br>6. Turn down the heat to low and add the coconut milk and soy sauce. Test the soup for spice and salt, adding more chilies and/or soy sauce (instead of salt) as desired.<br>7. Serve in bowls with coriander sprinkled over and quarters of fresh lime on the side.<br><br>Note: If this dish is to be served as an appetizer, the noodles can be omitted to create a lighter soup.
