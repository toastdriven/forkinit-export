            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. In a bowl, mix 1 1/4 C of the all-purpose flour and the yeast; set aside.  In a saucepan, heat buttermilk, water, margarine, sugar and salt until warm (120Ã‚Â° to 130Ã‚Â°F).  Add to flour mixture.  Beat with an electric mixer on low speed for 30 seconds, scraping bowl constantly.  Beat on high speed for 3 minutes more.  Using a spoon, stir in whole wheat flour and as much of the remaining all-purpose flour as you can.<br>2. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface.  Knead in enough of the remaining all-purpose flour to make a moderately soft dough that is smooth and elastic (6 to 8 minutes total).  Shape into a ball.  Spray a large mixing bowl with nonstick cooking spray.  Place dough in bowl, turning once to coat surface.  Cover; let rise in a warm place until doubled (about 1 hour).  Meanwhile, in a blender or food processor, combine green onions and olive oil.  Blend or process until chopped.  Add herbs and garlic.  Blend or process until finely chopped, stopping and scraping sides as necessary.  Spray a large baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray.<br>3. Punch dough down.  Turn out onto lightly floured surface.  Roll into a 16x8&quot; rectangle.  Spread herb mixture over dough to within 1&quot; of edges.  Starting with a long side, roll up tightly, jelly-roll style; pinch edges and ends to seal.  Place seam side down on baking sheet.  Cover; let rise in warm place until doubled (about 40 minutes).  Bake in a 375Ã‚Â°F oven for 25 to 35 minutes or until bread sounds hollow when you tap the top.  Remove from baking sheet.  Cool.  Makes 1 loaf.
