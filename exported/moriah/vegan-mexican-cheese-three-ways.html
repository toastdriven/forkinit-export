                To make the shakeable cheese, add all ingredients to a food processor and pulse until a fine meal is achieved. Store in a jar and refrigerate, and use on anything from tacos to salads to tofu scrambles.<br>To make the spreadable cheese, add raw cashews to a food processor and process into a butter, scraping down sides as needed. Add in spices and chipotle pepper and mix until until a spread is formed. You may need to add a little oil to help things blend together. Store in a jar and refrigerate to keep fresh, and use as a dip or spread.<br>To make the queso, simply scoop out desired portion of the spreadable cheese and add very hot water a little at a time and whisk until pourable. Use as a dip, spread, or topper for burritos, nachos, tacos and salads. Store leftovers in a jar in the fridge to keep fresh.
