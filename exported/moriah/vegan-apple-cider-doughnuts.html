            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                In medium mixing bowl whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon and nutmeg.<br><br>In a medium saucepan whisk together the sugar, apple butter, apple cider, coconut oil and salt. Place over medium heat and whisk until room temperature. This is so the cold apple cider and apple butter won&#x27;t re-solidify the coconut oil.<br><br>Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix until the ingredients just come together. You may have to use your hands to mix. Due to the varying water content of apple butter, the thickness of the dough may vary and may need to be adjusted with a tiny bit of flour or apple cider. You want to look for a dough that is wet enough to the point of where you can easily lift and place a cut doughnut on a slotted spatula without the dough coming apart, sticking to the spatula or distorting significantly.<br><br>Transfer the dough to a liberally floured surface and flatten to 1/2-inch with your hands. Use a 3 1/2-inch doughnut cutter or similar tool to cut doughnut shapes from the dough and transfer them to a lightly floured baking sheet. Coat the doughnut cutter in flour between cuttings for best results. Take the doughnut holes, re-flatten and cut into doughnuts to use up all of the dough.<br><br>Fill an 8 quart stockpot with 3 inches of peanut oil. It&#x27;s important to fill it 3 inches high because the amount of oil will hold heat and keep the temperature from dropping too low when the doughnuts are dropped in. Bring the oil to 375째F (191째C).<br><br>Line a couple baking sheets with a few layers of paper towels. Carefully place the doughnuts into the hot oil, 3 to 5 at a time and cook until golden brown, about 50 seconds per side. If you&#x27;re making doughnut holes, fry 6 to 12 at a time, about 50 seconds per side. A slotted spatula or skimmer works well to lower the doughnuts in, flip them and take them out when they&#x27;re ready. After cookings, transfer the cooked doughnuts to the baking sheet. Continue to cook the remaining doughnuts, returning the fat to 375째F (191째C) between fryings.<br><br>While the doughnuts are cooling, prepare your topping, if using. If you&#x27;re using the Glaze Topping, whisk together the confectioners sugar and apple cider vinegar in a small bowl until smooth. If you&#x27;re using the Cinnamon Sugar topping or Caramel Cinnamon Sugar topping, whisk the ingredients together in a bowl until combined. Coat the doughnuts in the topping and serve. They&#x27;re best eaten as soon as they&#x27;ve cooled but they will keep in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days.
