            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water.<br>2. Using a pastry blender or two knives, in a large bowl, cut butter into flour and salt until particles are the size of small peas. Add yeast mixture, sugar, warm milk, and egg; beat until smooth (dough will be very soft). Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours but not more than 24 hours.<br>3. When ready to use, remove from refrigerator. Punch dough down and divide in half; return other half to refrigerator. On a well-floured board, working quickly before dough softens, roll into a 15x10&quot; rectangle, approximately 1/4 to 1/2&quot; thick (if dough gets too warm from handling, return to refrigerator).<br>4. To prepare nut filling, in a large bowl, combine pecans or walnuts, brown sugar, and butter.  Spread half of the prepared nut filling down the center of the rolled-out dough rectangle in a 2&quot; strip. Fold sides of dough over filling, overlapping 1 1/2&quot;; pinch edges to seal.<br><br>Oval Shape: Form roll into a circle and pinch ends together. Place seam side down on a large greased baking sheet. Repeat same process with remaining dough and filling. Cover and let rise in a warm place for 30 minutes or until double in size.<br><br>Pretzel Shape: Lift the filled roll from both ends firmly and center the middle of the roll onto the baking sheet as if you were forming a circle. Pull the ends of the roll so that they make a cross above the roll, then pull the ends down and tuck the ends under the top part of the roll so that the ends stick out from under the roll.  Cover and let rise in a warm place for 30 minutes or until double in size.<br><br>5. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Bake for 20 minutes or until golden brown. remove from oven and let cool for 15 minutes.<br>6. To prepare glaze, in a medium bowl, combine powdered sugar, water, and vanilla.  Spread prepared Glaze over kringles. Sprinkle with chopped pecans or walnuts. Serve kringles warm or at room temperature.<br>7. To re-warm, preheat oven to 300 degrees F. Slide a whole, uncut kringle onto a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil. Cover loosely with a large piece of aluminum foil and heat for 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from oven and remove aluminum foil before slicing.<br><br>Makes 2 Kringles (each serves 10 to 12).
