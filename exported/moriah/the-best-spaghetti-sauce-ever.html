            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                In a food processor, chop onions, green pepper, and garlic in batches.<br>Heat a pot with a very generous amount of olive oil (about a 1/4 of an inch. Maybe more). Add onions, green pepper and garlic to oil and sauté for about 5 to 10 minutes. (You want the flavor to really go into the oil.)<br>Then add the onion, green pepper, and garlic mix to the roaster. Add the cans of tomatoes and tomato sauce. Add salt and pepper to taste (add more than you think would be enough. I added 3 to 4 tablespoons of salt and about 2 tablespoons of pepper).<br><br>Cook all day long.<br><br>You may either freeze in quart or gallon size freezer bags once cooled, you may can it or just have a huge party.<br><br>To can:<br>Sterilize jars and lids in boiling water for 10 minutes or more.<br>Fill still hot jars with hot spaghetti sauce with an inch left on top. Wipe the tops of the jars off with a clean cloth to be sure there’s no sauce on them.<br>Put lids on tightly.<br>Water bath jars for 40 minutes.<br>Let jars cool on the counter until sealed.<br>I got about 14 quarts worth this time.
