            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Heat large skillet.  Add onion, garlic, ginger and salt.  Saut√© until onion is soft.  Gentle browning is good.  Add the water and the carrot.  Mix, then cover and steam.  If the greens are raw, add them after 3-4 minutes so they will cook along with the carrots.  If the greens are already cooked, add them just before the carrots are fully cooked, perhaps 7-8 minutes, just so they get hot.  When all the vegetables are cooked the way you like them, add the lemon juice and lemon zest.  Mix and serve with rice, beans, pasta...anything.
