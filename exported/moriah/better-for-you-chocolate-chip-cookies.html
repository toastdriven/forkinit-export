                Pre-heat oven to 350Â°F. Line cookie sheet with non-stick foil.<br>In a bowl, whisk all ingredients (except the chips) together. When combined, gently fold in chips to incorporate.<br>Using a regular spoon, spoon about 2 T worth of batter onto the cookie sheet, about 1 1/2&quot; apart. The batter is loose, but it actually doesn&#x27;t spread a lot.<br>Bake for 8-10 minutes (until just slightly firm). Remove from oven and let cool for another 10 minutes on the cookie sheet. This is important to make sure they &quot;set up&quot; right.<br>Remove cookies from sheet and allow to finish cooling on a cookie rack. Store in an airtight container.
