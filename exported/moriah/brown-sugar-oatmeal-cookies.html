            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Preheat the oven to 350Â°F.<br><br>In the bowl of an electric mixer (or using a hand mixer), beat together the brown sugar and butter until fluffy. Beat in the vanilla. Add the eggs one at a time, scraping the bowl after each one.<br><br>Mix together the flour, salt and baking soda in a medium bowl. Add it into the creamed mixture in 2-3 batches, mixing until just combined. Mix in the oats until just combined.<br><br>Use your preferred size cookie scoop (or a regular spoon) to drop portions of dough onto baking sheets, spacing them a couple inches apart. Bake until dark and chewy, 12-13 minutes. If you&#x27;d like a crispier cookie, just cook a little longer!<br><br>Let the cookies cool slightly on the baking sheets, then transfer onto a plate for serving.<br><br>Optional: Add 1/2 cup finely chopped nuts to the flour mixture if you&#x27;d like a nutty flavor and crunch.
