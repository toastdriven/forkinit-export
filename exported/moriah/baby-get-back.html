                2 8-oz pkgs bean curd stick (available at most Asian markets; be sure to ask for bean curd stick, rather than bean curd sheets)<br>2 T warm melted margarine<br>1/4 C peanut butter (or more, to taste)<br>2 T miso<br>1/4 C nutritional yeast<br>2 tsp paprika<br>2 C barbecue sauce (without anchovies)

            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. Soak the bean curd in warm water for 4 to 6 hours.<br>2. When the bean curd is softened, drain, squeezing out the excess water and cut into 4&quot; to 6&quot; lengths.<br>3. In a large bowl, combine the margarine, peanut butter, miso, nutritional yeast, and paprika to form a rich paste. If the mixture is too thick, add a teaspoon of water at a time to thin to the desired consistency.<br>4. Preheat the oven to 375Ã‚Â°F.<br>5. Add the bean curd ribs to the paste, coating thoroughly.<br>6. Place the &quot;ribs&quot; side by side on a large baking sheet and bake for 25 minutes, turning to cook evenly, until the bottoms are crisp and brown.<br>7. Remove from the oven and, using a barbecue brush, apply the barbecue sauce to the &quot;ribs.&quot; Return to the oven and bake for an additional 10 to 15 minutes.<br>Makes 4 servings
