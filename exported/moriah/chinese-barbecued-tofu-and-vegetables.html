            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. Cut the tofu into 1/2&quot; thick slices. Place them on a few paper towels and cover them with 2 or 3 more. Press lightly to remove some of the moisture from the tofu. Cut the slices into triangles or other shapes.<br>2. Heat an oiled, non-stick skillet until hot, and place the tofu slices in it. Brown well on both sides. When they are done, place them in a crockpot that has been sprayed with non-stick spray. Set the crockpot to high heat and cover.<br>3. Using the same skillet, sautÃƒÂ© the onions, garlic, and ginger until the onion softens, about 3 minutes. Add the remaining ingredients and heat, stirring, until bubbly. Pour the sauce over the tofu and stir well to combine. Replace the cover and cook on high for 3 hours.<br>4. Prepare the broccoli stalks by trimming off the tough ends and peeling off the outer skin. Slice into 1/4&quot; thick rounds. After the tofu has cooked for 3 hours, add the broccoli and other vegetables. Stir well to combine and cover tightly. Cook for about 1 more hour. Vegetables should be tender but not over-cooked. Serve over brown rice. Makes 3-4 servings.<br><br>Cooking options:<br><br>*If you need to cook the tofu for a longer time, set the cooker on low and add 2 or 3 more tablespoons of water to the sauce. Cook for about 5-6 hours before adding the vegetables. Turn the heat up to high once the veggies are added. Note: This is not a good option for larger crockpots because the volume of food is too low.<br>*To cook this in the oven, preheat to 375 F and put the tofu and sauce into a non-metal baking dish coated with cooking spray. Cook for 30 minutes before adding the vegetables. Cover and cook for about 15 more minutes, until vegetables are just tender.<br>*Try using frozen and defrosted tofu and skip the pan-frying.
