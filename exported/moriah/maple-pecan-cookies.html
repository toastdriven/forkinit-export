            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. In a medium bowl, beat the butter with an electric mixer until pale and creamy, about three minutes.<br>2. Gradually beat in the sugar until well blended.<br>3. Add the maple syrup, egg replacer and Vanilla and mix until blended.<br>4. Mix in the flour and pecans until blended.<br>5. Divide the dough in half and shape into long logs (using a little flour on your hands if it gets sticky).  The easiest way to get a nice circular shape is to place the dough on the plastic wrap, pull the wrap around the log, and roll with your hand until round.  You may have to rewrap the log with a fresh piece of plastic wrap.  Refrigerate until firm - at least 2 hours.<br>6. Preheat the oven to 350Ã‚Â°F.  <br>7. Take the dough out of the refrigerator one roll at a time, unwrap and slice the dough into disks about 1/2&quot; thick.<br>8. Place the disks on an ungreased cookie sheet and bake for about 20-25 minutes, until golden.<br>9. Transfer to a wire rack to cool.  Store in a sealed tin.
