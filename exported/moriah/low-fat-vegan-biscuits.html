            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. Preheat oven to 425Â°F and spray a baking sheet lightly with cooking spray.<br>2. Mix flour together with baking powder, baking soda, salt and sugar and sift into a medium sized bowl.<br>3. Using a pastry cutter or wire whisk, cut butter into flour until the mixture becomes the consistency of fine crumbs.  Pour milk into dry ingredients all at once and mix together with a fork.  As soon as mixture holds together, turn out onto a floured work surface and knead gently.<br>4. Roll dough gently out to 1/2&quot; thickness and cut into 2 1/2&quot; round with a floured cutter.<br>5. For crustier biscuits, place rounds about 1&quot; apart on baking sheet.  For softer sides, place biscuits touching or 1/4&quot; apart.  Dust tops lightly with flour and bake for 10-12 minutes or until golden brown.
