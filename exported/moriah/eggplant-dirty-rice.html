            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Heat 2 T of the oil in a Dutch oven or other large oven-safe pan over medium-high heat. Add the celery, peppers, onion, salt and 1 tsp paprika. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Add the eggplant along with the remaining oil, thyme, pepper, chipotle, and remaining paprika. Cook for 8 minutes, stirring regularly, until the eggplant softens. Stir in the garlic and tomato paste and cook for 1 minute. Add the Worcestershire sauce and rice and stir to combine. Add the vegetable broth and bring the mixture to a boil. Remove from the heat, cover and place in the oven for 25 minutes or until the rice is just tender and most liquid is absorbed. Remove from the oven and let stand, covered, for 10 more minutes. Fluff gently with a fork and serve with hot sauce on the side.
