            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. Grease 10 of the cups in two extra large muffin tins.<br>2. Make batter as directed in the basic cake recipe.  Fold 1 1/2 C of coconut into batter.  Fill the cups 3/4 full and bake at 350Â°F for 18 to 20 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.  Cool in tins on racks for 5 minutes.  Then turn out onto racks to cool completely.<br>3. Combine the vegan butter, vegan cream cheese, vanilla and sugar in a large bowl and beat well with an electric mixer until smooth and spreadable.  Add a drop of red or rose-pink food coloring and blend well to make a light pink frosting.<br><br>To make snowballs:<br>1. Once cupcakes are cool, freeze them (in batches if necessary) on a parchment or wax-paper-lined tray for 20 minutes.  This will make them easier to frost.<br>2. When you&#x27;re ready to frost, remove the cupcakes from the freezer and spread a thick, even layer of frosting all over them.  Then, freeze them on the parchment-lined try for at least 30 minutes and up to a day.<br>3. Remove and spread a second, thick, even layer of frosting over the cupcakes.  Sprinkle generously with coconut (approximately 1/4 C).
