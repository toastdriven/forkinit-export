                If serving with rice and broccoli, begin preparing at this time. Otherwise, move onto the next step.<br>Wrap tofu in a clean, absorbent towel and set something heavy on top to wick away moisture, such as a cast iron skillet. Let rest for about 10 minutes.<br>Prep/chop green onions, garlic, and ginger at this time. Set aside.<br>While tofu is pressing, prepare sauce by combining sesame oil, cornstarch, minced garlic, minced ginger, rice vinegar, coconut sugar or maple syrup, tamari or soy sauce, and water in a small mixing bowl and whisk thoroughly to combine. If using coconut sugar, make sure it’s dissolved before proceeding. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed (I left mine as is).<br>Heat a large metal or cast iron skillet (mine is 10”) over medium heat. In the meantime, unwrap tofu and cut into even pieces, about 3/4&quot; cubes.<br>Add tofu to a shallow mixing bowl and top with tamari or soy sauce, chili garlic sauce, sesame oil, and maple syrup. Toss to combine. Let rest 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally.<br>Use a slotted spoon or fork to transfer tofu to a quart-size or large freezer bag. Add cornstarch 1 T at a time and toss to coat. Continue adding more cornstarch and tossing until tofu is coated in a gummy, white layer - about 5 T.<br>To the hot skillet, add 2 T grape seed oil and let warm for 30 seconds. Then use a slotted spoon or fork to add tofu to the pan (leaving any excess cornstarch behind).<br>Cook on all sides for 1 minute, or until light golden brown. You don’t want it blackened or burned, as you’ll be cooking it again later with the sauce. Aim for a consistent golden brown crust. Remove tofu from pan as it’s finished browning. Set aside.<br>Return skillet to burner and increase heat to medium-high. Add 1 T sesame oil, chopped green onions, and dried red chilies. Sauté for 1-2 minutes, stirring frequently.<br>Add the sauce and tofu. Cook, stirring frequently, to coat the tofu and vegetables for 1-2 minutes, or until warmed through and the sauce has slightly thickened.<br>Remove pan from heat and add sesame seeds (optional). Toss to coat.<br>Serve with rice and steamed broccoli (optional), or other desired sides. Best when fresh, though leftovers keep for 2-3 days in the refrigerator. Reheat on the stovetop or microwave.
