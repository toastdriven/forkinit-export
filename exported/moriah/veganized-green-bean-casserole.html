            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. In a greased casserole, combine all of the ingredients, except only half of the French fried onions and stir well to combine. Bake at 350Â°F for 15-20 minutes or until bubbly. Sprinkle the remaining French fried onions over the top of the casserole and bake an additional 5 minutes or until onions are crisp and golden brown.<br>2. In a saucepan, saute onions in canola oil until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and saute an additional 2 minutes. Add 5 C of the vegetable stock, tamari, sage, thyme, salt, and pepper, and simmer for 7 minutes or until onions are tender. In a bowl, whisk together remaining 3 C vegetable stock and the browned flour. Remove saucepan with simmering broth from the heat. Quickly whisk flour mixture into the broth to avoid lumps.<br>3. Return saucepan to the heat, whisking constantly, and continue to<br>cook until thickened. Whisk in parsley. Taste and add more salt and pepper if needed.<br>Yield: 6 1/2 cups.<br><br>**Note: To brown flour: simply place some flour in a non-stick pan, stirring constantly, and cook over low heat until flour reaches a golden color. Set aside to cool. It can be stored in an airtight container for many months.
