            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. Cut the tofu widthwise into 1/2&quot; slices. Then cut each slice widthwise into 1/2&quot;x1 1/2&quot; sticks. Put the pieces in a ziplock bag and add the vegetable broth, 1 T wine, and 1 T soy sauce. Let it marinate, turning the bag every few minutes, while you prepare the vegetables and sauce.<br>2. In a small bowl or measuring cup, mix together the vinegars, 2 T soy sauce, 1 T wine, agave nectar or sugar, chili garlic paste, and sesame oil. Set aside.<br>3. Peel and slice the water chestnuts and cut each slice into shreds, about three pieces per slice. Slice the green onions thinly, separating the dark green tops from the light green and white parts.<br>4. Spray a large non-stick skillet with oil, and heat it over medium-high heat. Add the light-colored scallion slices, the garlic, and the ginger, and stir-fry for 1-2 minutes. Remove from the skillet and set aside.<br>5. Spray the skillet again, and add the tofu and its marinade to the pan, making sure the tofu is in a single layer. When the marinade has evaporated, carefully turn the tofu (which should be light brown on the bottom) and cook the other side until brown. Add the green onion mixture back to the pan and cook, stirring for another minute.<br>6. Add the water chestnuts and sauce and bring to a boil. Add cornstarch and water and simmer until thickened and glossy. Remove from heat and garnish with green onion tops.
