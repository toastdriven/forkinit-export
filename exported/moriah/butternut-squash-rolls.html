                In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water.  Add sugar; let stand for 5 minutes.  Stir in the milk, squash, butter, brown sugar and salt.  Add whole wheat flour.

Place in a bowl coated with nonstick cooking spray, turning once to coat top.  Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.<br>Punch dough down and turn onto a floured surface; divide into 20 pieces.  Shape each piece into a ball.  Place 2 inches apart on baking sheets coated with nonstick cooking spray.  With a sharp knife, make shallow slashes on top of rolls.  Cover and let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes.<br>Bake at 400Â°F for 11-13 minutes or until golden brown.  Remove from pans to wire racks to cool.  <br>Yield:  20 rolls.
