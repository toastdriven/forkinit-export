                1. Preheat oven to 375F. Lightly oil a 9- by 13-inch baking pan.<br>2. Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan. SautÃ© the onion and garlic<br>until translucent. Add jalapeno, bell pepper, and sliced zucchini and<br>continue to sautÃ© until they have softened and the onion is golden.<br>Stir in tomatoes and seasonings. Bring to a simmer, then simmer<br>gently for 5 minutes. Add beans and stir well.<br>3. Layer as follows in the prepared pan: one layer of tortillas, then<br>half of the tomato-black bean mixture. Repeat. Top off with one more<br>layer of tortillas.<br>4. Quickly sautÃ© the olive oil, reserved bean mixture, and grated<br>zucchini together until zucchini is tender. Add salt. Pour this over<br>the top of the casserole.<br>5. Bake for 20 minutes. Let stand for 5 to 10 minutes, then cut into<br>squares or wedges to serve.<br>6. Alternately, once assembled, cover and freeze. Whenever you are ready for it, thaw in the fridge and bake as described.
