            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. Bring 6 cups of water to a boil in a large saucepan, add the lentils, and cook for about 20 minutes, or until tender. Drain and set aside.<br>2. While the lentils are cooking, make the saffron yogurt by combining the saffron threads and boiling water in a tiny cup. Let the saffron steep for a few minutes. Now stir the saffron along with the liquid into the yogurt. Mix in the salt and set aside.<br>3. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a heavy soup pot over medium heat, then add the onion and salt and saute until tender, a couple minutes. Stir in the tomatoes, lentils, and water and continue cooking for a few more minutes, letting the soup come back up to a simmer. Stir in the chopped greens, and wait another minute. Taste and adjust the seasoning if need be. Ladle into bowls, and serve with a dollop of the saffron yogurt.<br><br>Variations:<br>- You can serve it with a poached egg on top, or crunchy, fried shallots, with a drizzle of chive infused cream, or with chunks of tiny pan-fried butternut squash cubes.<br>- Make a thicker version by using just a bit of water, and then spoon it over an omelette in the morning.<br>- Have some cooked farro or wheat berries around? Toss some in. Millet might be good too.<br>- You can finish the soup by adding your favorite spices or spice blends. Smoked paprika, crushed chiles, toasted cumin, would all work nicely.
