                1. Combine the dry ingredients in a large bowl.  Heat the water and oil and stir into the dry mixture to form a soft dough.  Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead for about 5 minutes or until smooth, using only enough flour to keep dough from sticking to the hands and work surface.  Cover the dough and allow it to rest for about 10 minutes.<br>2. Preheat the oven to 375Â°F/190Â°C.  Divide the dough in half.  Divide each half into 3 strips and roll the strips on the work surface to lengthen them for braiding.  Braid 3 strips together for each of the loaves.  Place the braided loaves on a baking sheet.  Turn the ends under and pinch them to keep them secure as they rise during baking.<br>3. Bake the loaves for 15 minutes, then check for browning.  Because of the high sugar content of the dough, the temperature may need to be lowered and another sheet pan could be placed under the first one to protect the bottom of the bread.  The loaves should be golden and ready after about 25 minutes.  Remove to a wire rack to cool.  Serve with soy margarine, jam, preserves or Carrot Hazelnut Spread.
