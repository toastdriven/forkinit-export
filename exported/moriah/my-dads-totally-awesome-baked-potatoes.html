            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. Preheat oven to 400Ã‚Â°F.<br>2. Scrub potatoes and pierce with a knife or fork.  Bake on a sheet pan or in a large flat dish in the preheated oven until tender, about 1 hour.  Potatoes may be microwaved instead to save time.<br>3. Meanwhile, combine all ingredients except Italian dressing, cheese, bacon, sour cream and chives in a skillet.  Cook until vegetables are tender and mushrooms have let go of their juices.<br>4. When potatoes are tender, cut them in half lengthwise or make a slit lengthwise in the top and open them up to allow room for the filling.  Fill each potato with equal portions of cooked filling.  It should overflow the potatoes.<br>5. Sprinkle chopped bacon or Bacon Bits onto potatoes.  Drench each potato with approximately 1/4 C Italian dressing.  Then cover each potato with 1/4 C cheese.<br>6. Put potatoes back in the oven or microwave and heat until cheese is melted.<br>7. Garnish with sour cream and chives.  Serve immediately.
