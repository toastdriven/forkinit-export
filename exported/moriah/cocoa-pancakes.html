            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. Preheat an electric griddle to 350Ã‚Â°F, or use your favorite pancake pan.<br>2. Sift together the flour, Cocoa Powder, baking powder and salt into a large bowl.  Mix in the sugar.<br>3. In a jug or bowl with a pour spout, beat the egg, Vanilla Extract and milk.  Pour in the melted butter.  Make a well in the flour and add the milk mixture gradually to form a batter.  You can do this by hand or with an electric mixer.  Fold in the chocolate chips.<br>4. Pour a scant 1/4 C of batter into heart-shaped pancake molds and cook for 2-3 minutes per side.  You can flip the pancakes when they start to bubble and seem set.<br>5. Layer on parchment paper if you are not serving immediately.  To serve, top with toppings of choice.
