            <h3 class="underline">Ingredients</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                8 pitted medjool dates (about 150g)<br>1 cup of raw mixed nuts (or about 100g) *I used 1/3 C each of pistachios, cashews, and almonds<br>The zest of one navel orange, preferably organic (try not to get any of the bitter white pith)<br>1/2 tsp ground cardamom<br>1/4 tsp ground cinnamon<br>2 1/2 tbsp cocoa powder<br>A generous pinch of salt<br>1-2 tbsp hot water<br>1 tbsp cocoa nibs, optional (but totally awesome)
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-8">
            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Place the dates, nuts, zest, cardamom, cinnamon, cocoa powder, and salt in the bowl of a food processor. Process until the contents are chopped into small pieces and intermixed with one another. With the food processor running, add the hot water 1 T at a time until the mixture forms into a ball. Add the cocoa nibs, if using, and pulse a few times to incorporate them, but not pulverize. They’re there to add crunch!<br><br>Line an 8” x 8” square baking pan (or a slightly smaller container) with parchment paper and turn the mixture out into the pan. Using damp hands and a small offset spatula or the back of a spoon (an offset spatula is better), spread the mixture out until it is about a 1/4&quot; thick. (Note: If you’re using an 8” x 8” square baking pan for this, your mixture will not fill the container. Simply even it off so that it forms a 1/4&quot; rectangle within the pan.)<br><br>Place the pan in the freezer for an hour or two to set, you want the bars to be easy to cut and to remove, not too sticky. Cut into 8 bars. For optimal freshness, the bars will keep in the fridge for about a week if covered, and in the freezer, if wrapped well, for about a month.
