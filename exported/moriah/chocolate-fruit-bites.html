            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                In a small bowl, microwave the chocolate chips and coconut oil for 30 seconds.  Stir until smooth.  Microwave for additional 15-second increments as needed until the chocolate is melted.<br>In a food processor, grind almonds into desired consistency (anything from a fine powder to slightly chunky).  Pour in the melted chocolate mixture.  Process until thoroughly mixed.  Pour the chocolate-almond mixture into a small bowl.  Set aside.<br>Add dried apricots to the food processor and grind until it forms a rough paste.  Add in the peanut butter.  Process until everything is combined and the desired consistency is reached.<br>Grease a loaf pan.  Pour the mixture into the pan.  Evenly press down.  Note: I used half of the pan for thicker bites.<br>Cover and refrigerate for at least two hours before cutting.  Cut into 1x1&quot; bites.  Keep refrigerated to store.
