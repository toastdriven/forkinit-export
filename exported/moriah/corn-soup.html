                1. Preheat the oven to 400ÂºF.<br><br>2. Pierce the potatoes in a few places with a fork. Put the corn and the potatoes on a baking sheet and roast, turning occasionally, for 25 to 30 minutes, until the potatoes are fork-tender. Let cool.<br><br>3. Cut the kernels off the corn cobs and set aside. Break each corn cob into 2 or 3 pieces and set aside.<br><br>4. Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the shallots and garlic and sautÃ© for about 3 minutes, until the shallots start to soften. Add the corn cobs and stock, bring to a simmer, and simmer for 30 minutes.<br><br>5. Meanwhile, peel the potatoes and cut into chunks; set aside.<br><br>6. Strain the stock into a large bowl and add the corn kernels and potatoes. Transfer to a blender, in batches if necessary, and puree. Add the sour cream and blend well.<br><br>7. Pour the soup into a large saucepan and reheat gently over medium heat; do not let boil. Remove from the heat and season with salt and pepper.<br><br>8. Ladle the soup into bowls. Garnish with the smoked salmon (if using), sprinkle with the tarragon and cilantro, and serve immediately.
