            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1 cup raw almond butter (make sure it’s raw, not roasted..you can easily make your own)<br>1 cup medjool dates (soaked and pitted -I often substitute raisins)<br>1/4 cup raw carob powder (this is not the same as cocoa powder, but you could use that as well…it just wouldn’t be raw
            </p>
        </div>

            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                In a food processor, blend the dates to a smooth paste.<br>Add the remaining ingredients and process until smooth.<br>Remove from processor and form into round balls.<br><br>Note: These will keep for a long time in the refrigerator.
