            Variations include adding pine nuts, cider vinegar, roasted chestnuts, or thyme. Also great with bacon or pancetta. If adding pine nuts, add them during the last 5 minutes of cooking, or brown them separately and and to the finished dish.

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1 Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Place Brussels sprouts in a cast iron frying pan (or a roasting pan, but a cast iron frying pan will work great for this recipe). Toss in the garlic. Sprinkle Brussels sprouts with lemon juice. Toss with oil so that the sprouts are well coated. Sprinkle generously with salt (at least a half teaspoon) and a few turns of black pepper.<br><br>2 Put Brussels sprouts in oven on top rack, cook for 20 minutes, then stir so that the sprouts get coated with the oil in the pan. Cook for another 10 minutes. Then sprinkle with Parmesan (if using) and cook for another 5 minutes.<br><br>The sprouts should be nicely browned, some of the outside leaves crunchy, the interior should be cooked through.<br><br>Add more salt to taste. (Salting sufficiently is the key to success with this recipe.)
