            You&#x27;ll likely have a bit of dressing leftover. If I&#x27;m going to do to the trouble of making a special dressing, I like to have a little extra to use for the following day or two. You can toss broccoli with it. I&#x27;ve been doing a simple asparagus, chive, and lettuce salad with it as well.

                     4 ounces whole wheat spaghetti or linguini (or soba)<br>    1 small bunch of asparagus, sliced thinly (1/4-inch thick)<br><br>    1/2 cup walnuts, toasted<br>    1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil<br>    1 medium clove garlic, peeled<br>    2 tablespoons mellow white miso paste<br>    2 tablespoons white wine vinegar<br>    1 teaspoon honey<br>    2 big pinches salt (or to taste)<br>    1/4 cup+ warm water<br><br>    Topping ideas: sliced green onions, chopped chard stems and leaves that have been cooked for a minute or two in a skillet with a bit of olive oil and salt (see photo), chopped fresh chives, toasted walnuts<br>

            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Salt generously and cook the pasta per package instructions, being careful to not overcook. About 10 seconds before you are going to drain the noodles, add the asparagus to the pot. Now drain and toss with about 1/2 the walnut-miso dressing - you can make the dressing as you&#x27;re waiting for the pasta water to come to a boil. To make the dressing, use a food processor, blender or hand blender to puree the walnuts, olive oil, garlic, miso paste, vinegar, and honey. Add the warm water a bit at a time until the dressing is the consistency of a heavy cream. Taste and add salt if you think it needs it.<br><br>Add as much or as little dressing as you like to the noodles and toss well. Arrange in two bowls or on a platter - I finished off this version topped with sliced green onions, a bit of sauteed slivered rainbow chard leaves &amp; chopped stems, a few toasted walnuts, and some chives.
