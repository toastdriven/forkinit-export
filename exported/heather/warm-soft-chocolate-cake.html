                8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, plus more for the molds<br>2 teaspoons all-purpose flour, plus a little more for the molds<br>4 ounces bittersweet chocolate<br>2 eggs<br>2 egg yolks<br>1/4 cup sugar

            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. Heat the oven to 450Â°F. Butter and lightly flour four 4-ounce molds, custard cups, or ramekins; tap out the excess flour.<br><br>2. Use a double boiler set over hot (not boiling) water to heat the butter and chocolate together until the chocolate is almost completely melted. Meanwhile, beat the eggs, yolks, and sugar together with a whisk or an electric beater until light and thick. Beat the melted chocolate and butter together until creamy; it should be quite warm. Pour in the egg mixture, then quickly beat in the flour, just until combined.<br><br>3. Divide the batter among the molds. (At this point, you may refrigerate the desserts until you&#x27;re ready to eat, for up to several hours; bring them back to room temperature before baking.) Put the molds on a baking sheet and bake until the center is still quite soft but the sides are set, 6 to 7 minutes.<br><br>4. Invert each mold onto a plate and let sit for about 10 seconds. Unmold by lifting up one corner of the mold; the cake will fall out onto the plate. Serve immediately.
