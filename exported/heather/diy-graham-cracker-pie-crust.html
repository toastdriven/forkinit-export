            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Crush the graham crackers into fine crumbs - they should yield about 1 1/2 -2 cups. This is very easily done in the food processor, too. Measure out 2 cups of the crumbs. If you have any crumbs left over, just put in the freezer for use some other time.<br><br>Melt the butter and stir into the crumbs. Add the water. Press into a 9-inch pie pan. Use a paper towel to dab up any excess butter that&#x27;s oozing out.<br><br>If you&#x27;re using the crust for a no-bake recipe, pre-bake the crust for about 10 minutes at 375F. If you&#x27;re using it for a baked recipe, like pumpkin pie, there&#x27;s no need to pre-bake. Fill and bake as directed in your pie recipe.<br><br>You can also make these ahead and freeze, sealed in a plastic bag or under foil.
