            These are really yummy &quot;Armenian-style&quot; crackers.  They are super easy to make.

            <h3 class="underline">Ingredients</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1 1/2 cups bread flour (6.75 oz)<br>1/4 tsp salt (.06 oz)<br>1/2 tsp  instant yeast (.055oz)<br>1 tbsp honey (.75 oz)<br>1 tbsp vegetable oil (.5 oz)<br>1/3 cups water, room temp (1/3 a cup to 1/2 cup) (3 to 4 oz)
            </p>
        </div>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                In a small bowl, mix together all the ingredients with just enough water to make it form a ball.  I would not use a stand mixer.. Just use your hands or a spatula... It&#x27;s not a big ball.<br>Sprinkle some flour on the counter, and kneed by have for about 10 min (until it&#x27;s done). The dough will be a little firmer than standard bread dough.<br>Lightly oil a bowl, put the dough in.  Cover the bowl.  <br>Let it rise at room temp until it has doubled in size (about 90 min)<br>Preheat the oven to 350 deg F.<br>Roll the dough out (you will likely need some flour on the counter) until it&#x27;s super thin.<br>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.  Transfer the dough to the baking sheet.<br>If you want the crackers all the same size, cut the dough with a pizza cutter.  If you want to just snap it by hand, don&#x27;t cut it.<br>Bake for 15 to 20 min (until it is begins to brown evenly across the top).<br>Cool in the pan for 10 min.<br>
