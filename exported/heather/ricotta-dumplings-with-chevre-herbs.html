                1/2 cup part-skim ricotta cheese<br>2 large eggs<br>1 1/2 cups flour<br>3/4 teaspoon salt<br>Freshly ground black pepper<br>2 tablespoons of water, as needed<br>2 tablespoons unsalted butter<br>Handful fresh herbs (rosemary, flat-leaf parsley, sorrel, mint, thyme, or combination thereof) <br>2 ounces fresh chèvre

            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Place a 3-quart (or larger) saucepan of water over high heat. Salt generously and bring to a boil.<br>While waiting for the water to boil, whisk together the ricotta and eggs. Add the flour, salt, and a sprinkle of fresh black pepper. Mix together quickly and lightly with a spoon. If the dough is too thick and floury, add 1 to 2 tablespoons of water.<br>Turn the dough out onto a floured countertop and quickly pat it out. (Don&#x27;t add too much flour; these will be just slightly sticky.) Pat the dough out until it is about 1/2-inch thick, and cut into 1-inch squares.<br><br>Drop these little squares into the boiling water and cook for 2 to 4 minutes, or until they float to the top and are fully cooked inside. Remove them from the water with a slotted spoon.<br>Pour the water out of the pan and place back over medium heat. Melt the butter in the pan. While the butter is melting, chop the herbs roughly. When the butter has melted, add the herbs and cook for just a few seconds, stirring them until fragrant. Turn off the heat and add the cooked dumplings back to the pan. Toss with the herbed butter. Add the goat cheese in small dollops and toss.<br>Serve immediately.
