                In a large bowl, combine sugar, butter, cream cheese, salt, almond extract, vanilla and egg yolk.  Blend well.<br>Lightly spoon flour into measuring cup.  Stir in flour until well blended. <br>Chill dough for 2 hours.<br>Heat oven to 375 deg.<br>On a lightly floured surface, roll out dough, one third at a time.  (Recipe calls for 1/8in thick, but I think they taste better nice and thick). <br>Cute into desired shapes.<br>Place 1 inch apart on ungreased cookie sheet.  <br>Bake for 7 to 10 min or until lightly browned (watch closely, they brown quickly).
