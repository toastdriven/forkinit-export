            I found this on line. It&#x27;s supposed to be a good home made version of the soup.  I haven&#x27;t made it yet, but it sounds good to me.

                6 cups chicken broth<br>6 cups potatoes, peeled and cubed<br>1/2 teaspoon seasoning salt<br>1/4 teaspoon white pepper<br>1/4 teaspoon ground red pepper<br>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, cut into chunks, room temperature<br>4 slices bacon, cooked and crumbled (optional, but makes it really good)

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Combine broth, potatoes and spices. Boil on medium heat until potatoes are tender. Smash a few of the potatoes to release their starch for thickening. If you like it smooth smash more, if you like it chunky just smash a little of it. You can decide the texture of it. Reduce to low heat. Add cream cheese. Heat, stirring frequently, until cheese melts. Ladle into bowls. Sprinkle a little bacon over each bowl of soup.
