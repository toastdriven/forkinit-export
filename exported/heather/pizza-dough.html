            This is the best pizza dough I have ever had.  You have to make the dough the night before, but it isn&#x27;t more work than standard pizza dough.

            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Measure out water and put in freezer to get ice cold.<br>Combine flour, salt and yeast. <br>Slowly add in oil than water.  Add only enough water to get dough to the correct consistency.  Kneed for 5 to 7 min with stand mixer (45 sec with food processor)<br>Divide the dough into three pizzas (to make 12 in pizzas, or divide to whatever size you want).  Get out a zip lock bag for each piece of dough.<br>Shape dough into balls.<br>Put a little bit of oil in each bag.  Put one piece of dough in each bag. Make sure the dough is coated in oil.  Put bag in fridge.  It will keep in fridge for 3 days (or in freezer for 3 months.. Just take it out of freeze and into fridge the day before you want to use it).  Let it sit there overnight.<br>2 hours before you want to make the pizzas, take the dough out of the fridge.  Shape into disks using flour/spray oil to keep it from sticking.  Cover and let sit for about 2 hours.<br>Preheat oven as hot as it will go.<br>Shape and top the pizza.  Put on paddle and transfer to the oven.  Bake for about 5 to 8 min.
