                6 cups Oats (the recipe says to use quick cook ones, but I am gonna try it with the old fashioned ones I keep in the house)<br>Flavorings: (pick one, more or none)<br>Brown sugar and cinnamon (my favorite) <br>1 cup raisins <br>1/4 cup brown sugar<br>Alternative powdered sweetener <br>1/4 cup powdered creamer + 1/2 cup chopped dried fruit<br>2 tablespoons cinnamon<br>2 tablespoons brown sugar + 2 tablespoons cocoa powder<br>Or pick your own

            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Place 2 cups oatmeal into your blender or food processor. Blend until powder; if you need to do it in more than one batch, please do so! With zero wet ingredients, depending on your appliance, it can make things easier.<br>Mix powdered oats to a large mixing bowl and add remaining oats, and extra add-ins (if you so desire). Stir to combine. You want an even mixture with the powdered oats sticking to the larger oats and extra ingredients. I just put it all in the container I store them in, and give it a really good shake. <br>Place mixture in an airtight container or divide into equal portions and place in bags. Depending on your added ingredients this will usually be a heaping half cup, making it easy to measure out.<br>To eat, place contents of bag into a bowl or mug and add 3/4 cup boiling water. Stir and let stand for 3 minutes. Adjust water as needed for your preferred oatmeal consistency. Enjoy!
