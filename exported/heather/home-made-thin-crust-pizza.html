            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                3/4 cups (6 ounces) of water<br>1/2 teaspoon of active-dry yeast (if using instant yeast, you don&#x27;t need to dissolve it during the first step)<br>2 cups (10 ounces) unbleached all-purpose flour<br>1/2 tsp salt
            </p>
        </div>

            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                About 30 minutes to 1 hour before baking, pre-heat your oven to 500 degrees. If you have a baking stone, put it on a rack in the lower-middle part of the oven.<br>In a small bowl or liquid measuring cup, heat the water until it feels barely lukewarm when you test it with your finger (if the water is so hot that you can&#x27;t leave your finger in it, wait for it to cool down). Add the yeast to the water and use a fork or whisk to stir it into the water. Set this aside for a few minutes and allow the yeast to dissolve. It&#x27;s ok if the yeast doesn&#x27;t bubble, but it should be entirely dissolved and the mixture should look like thin miso soup.<br>Measure out the flour into a large mixing bowl. Add the salt and use your hand or a whisk to combine.<br>Make a well in the center of the flour and pour in the water-yeast mixture. Use your fingers or a wooden spoon to combine everything together.<br>When it comes together into a cohesive ball (see image below), turn it out onto the counter along with any extra flour in the bowl that hasn&#x27;t yet gotten worked in.<br><br>Knead the dough until all the flour is incorporated and the dough is smooth and elastic to the touch--about five minutes.The dough should still feel moist and slightly tacky. If it&#x27;s sticking to your hands and counter-top like bubble gum, work in more flour one tablespoon at a time until it&#x27;s smooth and silky<br><br>Tear off two pieces of parchment paper roughly 12-inches wide. Work one piece of the dough in your hands and form it into a large disk. Lay the disk of dough on the parchment paper.<br>Working from the middle of the dough outwards, use the heel of your hand to gently press the dough outward until it&#x27;s about 1/4 of an inch thick or less. You can also use a rolling pin for this part. We like to make free form pies, but if you&#x27;d like a circular pie, you can trace a large circle on the back of the parchment to use as a guide.<br>Repeat with the second piece of dough.<br>Note: The dough will stick to the parchment paper, making it easier for you to roll out. You&#x27;ll bake the pizza right on the parchment paper. As it cooks, the dough will release from the parchment, and you can slide the paper out before serving.<br><br>Spoon a few tablespoons of sauce into the center of each pizza and use the back of a spoon to spread it out to the edges. Pile on all of your toppings except the cheese.<br>Using a bread peel or the backside of a baking sheet, slide your pizza (still on the parchment) onto the baking stone in the oven. If you don&#x27;t have a baking stone, just bake it right on the baking sheet.<br>Bake for about 5 minutes and then rotate the pizza 180-degrees (most ovens have &#x27;hot spots&#x27; your pizza will bake unevenly if it&#x27;s not rotated). Bake for another 3 minutes and then sprinkle the cheese over the top. Bake for another 2-3 minutes until the edges are golden brown and crispy.<br>Remove your pizza from oven and let it cool on a wire rack. At this point, you can slide the parchment paper out from under the pizza. Repeat with second pizza.<br><br>
