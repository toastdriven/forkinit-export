            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                4 large eggs, at room temperature<br>1 cup delicately flavored olive oil (such as Bertolli Classico) <br>2/3 cup water<br>2 cups pureed pumpkin (fresh or canned)<br>3 cups sugar<br>3 1/3 cups sifted all purpose flour<br>1 1/2 teaspoon salt<br>1 teaspoon ground nutmeg<br>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br>1 teaspoon ground cloves<br>2 teaspoons baking soda<br>1/2 cup golden raisins or dried cranberries (optional)<br>1/2 cup coarsely chopped walnuts or pecans (optional)

            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease three 1-pound loaf pans (8.5-by-4.25-by-2.75 inches) with olive oil or spray with cooking spray (or bake in batches).<br>In a large mixing bowl, lightly beat the eggs. Add the olive oil, water, pumpkin purée, and sugar and whisk with a fork to combine thoroughly.<br>Sift some flour into a small bowl. Measure out 3 1/3 cups of sifted flour by spooning the flour into a measuring cup and leveling off the top with a knife. Then sift the measured flour again together with the salt, nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, and baking soda into the mixing bowl. Stir into the wet ingredients until just combined. Stir in raisins, cranberries, or nuts, if using.<br>Pour into prepared loaf pans, nudging batter into corners. Bake for 45 minutes to an hour, or until a cake tester inserted into the center comes out clean. Cool on a rack for 10 minutes before removing from pan to cool completely. The bread will keep at room temperature for more than a week if tightly wrapped in plastic. It also freezes beautifully.
