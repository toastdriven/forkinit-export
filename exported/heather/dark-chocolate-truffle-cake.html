            This looks really good..  It&#x27;s made in a rice cooker, though I don&#x27;t see why it couldn&#x27;t be made in a regular oven...

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                <br>Pour 2 cups of water into the inner pot of the AromaÂ® rice cooker and close the lid. Press the Steam/Cook button and bring the water to a boil in approximately 8 minutes. Place the cookie crumbs in the bottom of a 1-2 quart baking dish that fits into the inner pot. In a medium bowl, add the sugar to the warm melted chocolate, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Add the eggs, one at a time, whisking to incorporate each egg. Add the vanilla and salt. Add the milk, whisking until the batter becomes completely blended. Gently pour the batter over the cookie crumbs. <br><br>Cover with a piece of foil that fits the top of the dish. Open the lid, using caution to avoid steam burns. Using a cooking mitt and a foil pan lifter place the dish in the boiling water. Close the lid and cook for 45 minutes. Open the lid, and use a cooking mitt and the foil pan lifter to remove the dish to a rack to cool. Serve while warm or chill for up to 4 hours before serving.<br>
