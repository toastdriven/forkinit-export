            These are mini-pizzas cooked in a muffin pan.  It makes a great personal very deep dish pizza.  I&#x27;ve only done this once, but it was a lot of fun.  The leftovers are super portable (can anyone say lunchboxable ?)  This would be great of a kids &quot;make your own pizza&quot; party so everyone could have their own toppings...

                Make your favorite pizza dough. <br>Instead of shaping it into standard pizzas, grease a muffin pan.  Make sure you grease the top (flat part) of the pan as well as the muffin cup part.<br>Preheat oven to 450 (or if your muffin pan can do hotter, go as hot as you can).<br>Divide the pizza dough into small pieces, one for each &quot;muffin&quot; you want to make.  My standard honey whole wheat dough makes more than 12 of these muffins.  <br>Shape dough into a Thin flat circle. (the dough will rise in the muffin pans)<br>Put dough circles into the muffin pan.  Push the centers in.<br>Fill with sauce, cheese, etc.  Whatever you want. If you are using a topping that needs to be fully cooked (i.e. chicken/ ground beef, etc) make sure it&#x27;s cooked before adding it.  There isn&#x27;t a lot of cook time.<br>Bake until the crust is a nice golden brown and the cheese is melted.  It took about 10 minutes for me.<br><br>
