            I made this once.  I didn&#x27;t use the full amount of Parmesan cheese, but it was yummy.

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1 cup unbleached all-purpose flour, plus more as needed<br>1 cup cornmeal<br>1/2 cup lightly packed finely grated Parmesan cheese<br>3 tablespoons butter, softened<br>3/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br>Salt for topping

            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Put flour, cornmeal, 3/4 cup cool water, the cheese, butter, and kosher salt in a food processor and process until the mixture forms a ball, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the processor, cover with a towel to prevent drying, and let the dough rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes and up to 2 hours.<br><br>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.<br><br>Divide the dough into 2 equal portions. On a lightly floured work surface, roll out the dough very thinly and evenly, flipping it over and continuing to roll while adding more flour as needed if the dough sticks. Stop rolling just short of 1/8 inch thick. <br>Sprinkle the dough lightly with the flaky salt and continue to roll just to embed the salt and seeds into the dough. Cut into strips about 2 inches wide and poke the strips evenly in several places with the tines of a fork. Using both hands, pick up either end of each strip carefully and lay it down on the pizza stone. <br><br>Bake until the crakers begin to brown and become crisp, keeping in mind that the crackers will continue to crisp up as they cool. If they donâ€™t crisp up properly after they cool slightly, you can put them back in the oven for a few minutes. Total baking time takes about 12 minutes on a stone and 15 to 18 minutes on a baking sheet. You will need to bake in two or three batches. Watch it closely since it burns quickly.<br><br>Let the crackers cool completely and break them into irregular shards of the desired size and shape. Store in an airtight container. Will stay crisp for up to 2 weeks at room temperature.
