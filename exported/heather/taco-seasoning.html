            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1 teaspoon Cornstarch<br>2 teaspoons Chili Powder<br>1 1/2 teaspoons Kosher Salt<br>2 teaspoons Garlic Powder<br>1 teaspoon ground Cumin<br>1 teaspoon Cayenne Pepper/Paprika<br>2 teaspoons dried Onions

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Measure: Measure out all ingredients side by side to ensure you don&#x27;t double up or leave one out.<br>Mix: Combine ingredients in a zip top bag or bowl and shake/stir to combine until cornstarch and onions are well distributed.<br>Store: Keep in an air tight container for up to 1 year.<br>To Use: 7 teaspoons of mix is enough to season 1 pound of meat. We often start with 4 teaspoons and increase it from there. Some meats like turkey and chicken take less, while pork and beef might take a little more. Play to your own tastes and remember, you can always add more, but you can&#x27;t take it out!
