                dough:<br>7/8 cup milk<br>1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract<br>1 large egg yolk<br>2 tbsp butter, in pieces<br>1/2 tsp salt<br>2 1/4 cup all purpose flour<br>1/4 cup sugar<br>1 tbsp cinnamon<br>2 1/4 tsp yeast<br><br>Oat Crumb Topping:<br>3/4 cup all- purpose flour<br>3/4 cup light brown sugar<br>1/2 cup rolled oats<br>1/2 cup chopped oats<br>2 tbsp cinnamon<br>1/2 cup butter, room temp

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Combine all the dough ingredients in the bread machine and run on the dough cycle.   Or, combine dough ingredients in in a mixer and let rise for at least one hour.<br>While the dough is rising, combine all the topping ingredients together in a plastic bag. Put the butter in the bag in pieces.  Grease a 13X9 pyrex baking dish.<br>When the dough cycle is done, or the dough has risen for at least an hour, Put the dough in the the pyrex.  The dough will be very sickly so you will have to use some extra flour. Make sure you &quot;push&quot; the dough into all the corners.<br>Spread the topping over the dough, and cover with plastic.  Let it rise at room temp for at least 30 min ( I usually let it rise for at least 2 hours ).<br>Bake at 350 deg F for 20 to 25 min or until edges are golden brown.<br>
