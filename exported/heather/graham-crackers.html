                1/2 cup white flour<br>2 cups cup whole wheat flour, or graham flour <br>1/4 cup sugar<br>1/2 teaspoon salt<br>1/2 teaspoon baking soda<br>1 teaspoon baking powder<br>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br>1 stick cold butter, cut into small pieces<br>2 tablespoons honey<br>1 tablespoon molasses<br>1/4 cup water

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Combine all the dry ingredients in a large bowl. Cut in the butter until the texture is dry and crumbly. (Also, you can do this in a food processor; just blend the butter in short bursts.)<br><br>In a small bowl, mix the honey, molasses, and water. Toss this with the dry ingredients until well blended. Scrape the sides of the bowl with your fingers and form the dough into a ball. Wrap in plastic wrap and chill for at least an hour.<br><br>Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Roll the dough out on a counter or on wax paper, sprinkled with whole wheat flour. Use a pastry scraper or an index card as a guide to cut the dough into small rectangles. Poke each cracker with a fork, then place them on an ungreased baking sheet.<br><br>Bake for about 15 minutes or until lightly browned and crispy. If stored in an airtight container these will keep for a couple weeks. <br>
