            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1 cup all-purpose flour<br>3/4 tsp. salt<br>1/2 tsp. ground pepper (optional)<br>4 TBSP cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces<br>8 ounces grated cheddar cheese<br>3 Tbsp water (maybe 1 more)

            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                In the food processor : Pulse the flour, salt and pepper, then add butter and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add grated cheese a little at a time until the mixture again resembles coarse meal.<br>Pulse in 3 to 4 tablespoons of water, one tablespoon at a time, until the dough forms into a ball. It will probably take a minute or so.<br>Remove, wrap in plastic, and chill for 20 minutes or up to 24 hours.<br>Roll the dough out to 1/8th-inch thickness directly onto a baking sheet. You don&#x27;t want to roll them paper thin, neither do you want to roll them too thick. If they are too thin, they will not puff up as much. If they are too thick, they will not be as crispy.<br>Preheat oven to 350 deg.<br>Using a knife or pizza cutter, cut 1 inch squares. (Or use cookie cutters).<br>Bake at 350Â° F for 15-20 minutes or until crackers are golden brown. Watch them after the 10 minute mark.
