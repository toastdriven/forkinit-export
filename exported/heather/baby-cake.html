            This idea looks really neat.  I haven&#x27;t tried it yet, but I like the idea of a small cake that doesn&#x27;t take long to make

                For the yellow cake:<br>1 cup cake flour<br>1/2 teaspoon baking powder<br>1/8 teaspoon salt<br>3/4 cups (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter<br>1 cup sugar (I use organic sugar, which has a slightly coarse grain)<br>3 large eggs<br>1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br><br>For the chocolate frosting:<br>4 tablespoons unsalted butter<br>2 ounces unsweetened chocolate, chopped<br>2 cups confectioners’ sugar<br>1/4 cup milk<br>2 teaspoons vanilla extract

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                For the cake: <br>Preheat the oven to 350° F. Butter and flour two 6-inch round cake pans and knock out the excess flour.<br>Sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt. In a large bowl, using an electric mixer on medium speed, beat the butter until soft and creamy. Add the sugar and continue beating until the mixture is light and fluffy, 2-3 minutes. (If you’re using the organic sugar, the texture of your mixture will be quite gritty.) Beat in the eggs, one at a time. Add the vanilla. On low speed, gradually add the dry ingredients until thoroughly blended.<br>Spoon equal amounts of batter into each pan and smooth the tops evenly. Bake for about 30 minutes, or until light golden and a cake tester comes out clean. Let the layers cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then unmold onto wire racks to cool completely.<br><br>For the frosting: In a small, heavy saucepan, melt the butter and the chocolate over low heat. In a medium bowl, combine the confectioners’ sugar with the milk and vanilla and stir until smooth. Add the chocolate mixture. Set the bowl over another another bowl half-filled with ice water. With a rubber spatula, beat just until the frosting is thick enough to spread.<br>Spread one cake layer with about one-fourth of the frosting. Set the second layer on top and spread the remaining frosting on the sides and top of the cake, swirling with your spatula.
