                1  cup sifted cake flour (3 ounces)<br>1 1/2  cups sifted granulated sugar (10 1/2 ounces)<br>1 3/4 cups egg whites (requires about 12 large eggs)<br>1  teaspoon cream of tartar <br>1/4 teaspoon salt<br>1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract <br>1 1/2 teaspoons lemon juice <br>1/2 teaspoon almond extract

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. Adjust the oven rack to the lower-middle position.  Preheat oven to 325Â° F.<br><br>2. In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and 3/4 cup sugar. Put remaining 3/4 cup sugar in a large measuring cup (or other container that pours easily).<br><br>3. Using either a stand mixer or a hand mixer, beat the egg whites until they are just broken up. With the mixer running, add the cream of tartar and salt.<br><br>4. Increase the mixer speed to medium and beat egg whites until soft and fluffy.<br><br>5. With the mixer still running on medium speed, gradually incorporate the remaining 3/4 cup sugar, about a tablespoon at a time. Beat until egg whites are smooth, glossy, and form soft peaks.<br><br>6. Remove bowl from mixer. Sift about 1/4 cup of the flour/sugar mixture over the egg whites. Gently fold together using a rubber spatula. Repeat with remaining flour/sugar mixture until all ingredients are well-combined.<br><br>7. Transfer the batter to the UNGREASED tube pan, smoothing the top. Give the cake a couple of firm raps on the counter to remove any large air bubbles.<br><br>8. Bake in the preheated oven for 50 to 60 minutes, until cake is golden brown and springs back when pressed firmly near the center.<br><br>9. Immediate flip the cake upside and elevate by putting the pan over the neck of a bottle (if using a traditional angel food cake pan use the prongs around the side of the pan to elevate). Cool the cake in the pan for at least 2 hours.<br><br>10. When cool, run a knife along the edge of the cake pan to loosen the sides. Be careful not to remove the golden crust from the cake.<br><br>11. Cut into slices by sawing back and forth with a serrated knife.
