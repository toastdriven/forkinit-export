            This sounds like an awesome idea.   It&#x27;s so easy, I wish I had thought of it.   You could use any shape you want, and any filling (like carmel, jam, cheese, etc).  I just need to figure out if the egg wash is gonna be a problem.  The on line recipe says to use an egg wash, but I can&#x27;t.

                1 unbaked pie crust<br>1 bag chocolate chips, cheese, camels, etc<br>1 egg (i don&#x27;t think egg replacer will work... gotta find out what how to stick them together without egg)

            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1.Pre-heat your oven to 375 degrees.<br><br>2. Mix 1 whole egg in a small bowl until combined. Set aside.<br><br>3. Roll out pie crust to 1/8 of an inch. It doesn&#x27;t have to be perfect, but as close as possible is always a good thing. <br><br>4. Using a cookie cutter, cut out your shapes.  You will need an even number of shapes.  Put extra/leftover dough back in fridge to chill while assembling to make batch 2.<br><br>5. Place 1 layer of dough cut outs on the baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Leave an inch between each (more if it&#x27;s handmade dough and slightly thicker) piece. Save the tops for a different step.<br><br>6. Add a small amount of chocolate chips (say a tablespoon for large ones, less for smaller), making sure to keep them in the center of each shape and keeping them away from the edges.<br><br>7. Using the pastry brush, run a line of egg wash around the outside of the filling on the edge of the pie crust. Place the top piece over it and gently press the edges together. You shouldn&#x27;t have to press hard as the egg does the work for you, but making sure all the edges touch is imperative to having them come out of the oven without leaks!<br><br>8. Go over the top of each tart with your egg wash and gently sprinkle with granulated sugar or sanding sugar of your choice.<br><br>9. Allow tarts to bake for 10-15 minutes (depending on size) or until golden brown. Allow to cool on parchment paper before transferring to a cooling rack (though the entire sheet of parchment paper can be moved to a rack to reuse the pan for the next batch).
