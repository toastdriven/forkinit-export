            A traditional Xmas cookies from my husband&#x27;s family.  The batter makes a HUGE batch (12 cups of flour !!!).  It is similar to a gingerbread cookie.  The can be rolled into &quot;logs&quot; and frozen.  The logs keeps for up to 6 months in the freezer so for one day of work, you get fresh cookies all winter.
