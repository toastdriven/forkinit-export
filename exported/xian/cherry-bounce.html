                2 gallon bags of Sour Cherries<br>4 cups sugar<br>4 cups water<br>1.5 liters of Grey Goose Vodka<br>1.5 liters of Christian Brothers VSOP Brandy<br>2 Cinnamon sticks

            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Requires 2 Glass Jugs<br><br>Clean the cherries, empty the jugs. Wash and stem the cherries, leave the pits.<br><br>Make the simple syrup. Bring the water and sugar to a near boil, stirring occasionally. It is really that simple.<br><br>Fill the jugs. Put the stemmed cherries in each of the jugs. Pour half of the syrup (through a funnel) over the cherries. Add the vodka to one jug and the brandy to the other. Lastly, put one cinnamon stick in each jug. Put the top on, give each of them a light shake to mix the contents.<br><br>Wait 2000 hours, or three months. Every couple of days, toss the liquor around a bit to keep it stirred. If you do this around cherry harvest (late summer), you will have an amazingly aged holiday drink.
