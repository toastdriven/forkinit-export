            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Cut butternut squash in half lengthwise. Scoop out stringy parts and squash seeds and discard. Score each half of the butternut squash using a sharp knife. Add approx. 1/4 inch of water to a pyrex baking dish. Place butternut squash in baking dish with inside of squash facing up. Bake butternut squash for approximately 1.5 hours, or until soft. When squash has finished baking, lower temperature of oven to 350 degrees.<br><br>2. After butternut squash has cooled enough to touch, scoop butternut squash from skins. Discard skins. Place squash in a large bowl.<br><br>3. To bowl with squash, add neufchatel cheese in chunks, green onions and all spices and salt. Start by mashing mixture using potato masher. Once the combination is beginning to combine, mix using an electric mixer, until smooth. Taste the squash mixture at this point and if necessary, add more spices, salt, or neufchatel cheese. Note: this mixture can be made earlier in the day or even the day before, refrigerated, and used as the filling when you are ready.<br><br>4. Before preparing tomato mixture, place corn tortillas in oven-safe baking dish and place in oven for a few minutes to warm them so that they are pliable. Then, in a separate medium bowl, combine tomato sauce, salsa, and hot sauce to taste. The goal here is to create a &quot;spicy tomato sauce&quot;. Stir until blended. If you&#x27;d like, add more salsa. If tortillas are now pliable, remove them from the oven but keep the oven on.<br><br>5. Assemble enchiladas by placing a heaping soup spoonful (approx. 1/4 cup) in each corn tortilla, rolling, and placing seam-side down in a baking dish. Cover filled tortillas with tomato sauce mixture. Sprinkle grated cheese on top.<br><br>6. Cover dish with foil and bake until warmed throughout, approximately 30 minutes.<br><br>7. Provide lettuce sliced in strips, diced tomatoes, and plain yogurt as optional toppings.<br>
