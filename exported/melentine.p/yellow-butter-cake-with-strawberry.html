            The yellow cake can, of course, be made without the strawberries and frosted to your own exacting specifications.

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Yellow Butter Cake: <br>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Butter and flour (or spray with a non stick vegetable/flour spray) two 9 x 2 inch (23 x 5 cm) cake pans or one 9x13. <br>Prepare strawberry mixture listed below to be finished before your cake is ready to bake. <br><br>In a bowl sift or whisk the flour with the baking powder, and salt.<br><br>In the bowl of your electric mixer, or with a hand mixer, beat the butter until soft and creamy (about 1-2 minutes). Gradually add the sugar and beat until light and fluffy (about 3-5 minutes). Add egg yolks, in two batches, beating well after each addition. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed. Add the vanilla extract and beat until combined.<br><br>With the mixer on low speed, alternately add the flour mixture (in three additions), and milk (in two additions), beginning and ending with the flour.  <br><br>Evenly divide the batter between the prepared pans, smoothing the tops with an offset spatula or back of a spoon. Drop half of strawberry mixture by spoonfuls onto top of cake and swirl gently with a butter knife   Bake 22 to 28 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake just comes out clean and the cake springs back when pressed lightly in center.  <br><br>Place the cakes on a wire rack to cool, in their pans, for about 10 minutes. Then invert the cakes onto a greased rack. To prevent cracks, reinvert cakes so that tops are right side up. Cool completely before frosting.<br><br>Strawberry Swirl Mixture:<br>Heat strawberries in saucepan. <br>Beat softened cream cheese and sugar/cornstarch mixture and eggs in a medium bowl. <br>Slowly beat in strawberries. <br>Return to pan and heat until thickened.  Mix in almond extract.  <br>Swirl half on cake before baking and mix the other half with a white frosting of your choice. (Note: frostings that contain butter will not mix as thoroughly with the strawberries, but still taste great)
