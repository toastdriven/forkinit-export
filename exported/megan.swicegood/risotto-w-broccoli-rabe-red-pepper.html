                1. Combine broth and water in a large saucepan and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to low ato maintain a simmer.<br>2. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat; add bell pepper and onion and cook, stirring, until softened, 4-6 minutes. Add garlic, rosemary and crushed red pepper and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in rice and cook, stirring, for 1 minute more.<br>3. Ladle 1/2 cup of the simmering liquid into the skillet and cook, stirring frequently, until most of it has been absorbed, about 1 minute. Continue stirring and adding liquid as it is absorbed, 1/2 cup at a time, until you&#x27;ve added 4 cups, about 15 minutes total.<br>4. Stir in broccoli rabe and the remaining liquid. Cook, stirring, until the rice is just tender and the mixture is creamy, 5-7 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in Parmesan. Season with pepper.
