            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1) Place the garlic and carrot in a food processor and pulse until finely chopped. Add onion and continue to pulse until minced, scraping the side of the bowl with a rubber spatuala occasionally.<br>2) Heat olive oil in a large, heavy pot over medium-low heat. Add the onion mixture and cook, stirring frequently, until soft but not browned, about 11 minutes. Add the wine and stir well, loosening any bits stuck to the bottom of the pot. Bring to a simmer and cook until reduced slightly, about 3 minutes.<br>3) Add the tomatoes and their juices to the pot. Add basil, oregano, and the and let simmer gently until the flavors are concentrated, 35-45 minutes. Add the salt and pepper. Taste for sweetness and if the sauce tastes too acide add 1-2 teaspoons of sugar. If you are planning on using sauce immediately, let it cool to room temperature. It can be refrigerated covered, for up to 1 week or frozen for up to 3 months.
