                INGREDIENTS:<br>2 cups buttermilk (or 2 tablespoons vinegar + enough whole milk, 2% milk, or unsweetened almond milk to equal 2 cups)<br>1 cup pumpkin puree (here’s a handy dandy tutorial on making your own)<br>2 eggs<br>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly + more for cooking, if desired (can sub vegan butter or coconut oil)<br>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract<br>2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour<br>1/3 cup granulated sugar<br>1 tablespoon baking powder<br>½ teaspoon baking soda<br>2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice blend*<br>1/2 teaspoon fine-grain sea salt or table salt<br>Butter and maple syrup for serving

            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                DIRECTIONS:<br>To a large bowl, add the buttermilk. If using the vinegar plus milk option, let sit for about 10 minutes to allow the milk to turn to buttermilk.<br>Add the pumpkin, eggs, butter, and vanilla and stir with a whisk to combine.<br>In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, spices, and salt.<br>Pour the dry ingredients over the wet and mix just until incorporated. Do not overmix.<br>Let batter rest for about 5 minutes.<br>Heat a non-stick griddle to 325 degrees or set large frying pan over medium heat. Melt a little butter on the cooking surface, spreading it evenly, if desired (if the surface is non-stick, you may not need to do this). Using a 1/3 cup measure (or, my pancake scooping weapon of choice, a trigger-handled ice cream scoop), pour the batter onto the griddle or into the frying pan. The pancakes are ready to flip when they look a little dry around the edges and start to form little bubbles, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip and cook on the other side until golden brown and completely cooked through, 1 to 2 more minutes.<br>Serve topped with butter and maple syrup, if desired.<br>* Or you can substitute the following if you don’t have pumpkin pie spice blend on hand:<br>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br>1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg<br>1/4 teaspoon ground ginger<br>1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
