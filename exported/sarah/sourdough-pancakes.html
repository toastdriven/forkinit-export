Then feed the starter with flour and water. Let this sit eight (8) hours or preferably overnight. It is now ready to use in your sourdough pancakes!

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                In a large bowl, add sourdough starter, sugar, egg, olive oil, and salt; mix well; set aside.<br>In a small bowl, dilute 1 teaspoon baking soda in 1 tablespoon of warm water; set aside until ready to bake your pancakes.<br>Important: Only add the baking soda/water mixture to the pancake batter just before you are ready to cook the pancakes. Make certain everything is ready to go, the griddle hot, so the Sourdough can be cooked while the air is still working in the batter. This will produce light sourdough pancakes that melt in your mouth.<br>When ready to cook your sourdough pancakes, fold the baking soda/water mixture gently into the prepared pancake batter (do not beat). This will cause a gentle foaming and rising action in the batter. Let the mixture bubble and foam a minute or two before using.<br>Heat up a lightly-greased griddle (I like to use my cast-iron skillet griddle) until fairly hot; then pour the sourdough pancake batter onto the griddle. For each pancake, pour 1/4 to 1/2 cup sourdough pancake batter onto hot griddle. I have that using my soup ladle makes the perfect size pancakes.<br>Cook the pancakes 1 to 2 minutes on each side or until golden brown and bubbly. Remove from heat and serve.<br>Because I have an oven warming drawer, I usually keep the prepared pancakes on a plate in the warming drawer until they are all cooked, and then I served them to my family. If you don&#x27;t have a warming drawer, just turn your oven on low and use it the same way.<br><br>
