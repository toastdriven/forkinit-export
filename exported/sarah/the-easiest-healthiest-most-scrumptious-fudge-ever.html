            <h3 class="underline">Ingredients</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1/2 cup of virgin coconut oil or butter<br>1/2 cup of cocoa powder<br>1/2 cup of coconut/palm sugar (the paste like kind) (or substitute slightly less honey)<br>dash of sea salt<br>1/2 teaspoon vanilla<br>almond butter (optional)
            </p>
        </div>

            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                In a heat resistant, glass measuring cup (pyrex), place the coconut oil. Fill a small saucepan with a few inches of water, and place the glass measuring cup in it. Heat on the stove top until the coconut oil is mostly melted (the coconut oil should be room temperature, not hot. This will protect it’s raw benefits).<br>In a food processor using the regular blade, add the melted coconut oil and the rest of the ingredients and mix until well combined.<br>Place enough plastic wrap or parchment paper in a loaf pan to cover the bottom and sides of the pan. Scrape your fudge “dough” into the loaf pan, and fold the plastic wrap or parchment paper over the top of the fudge. Gently press down, to even out the thickness of the fudge (you want it to be about 1/2 inch thick, it will cover probably about 1/2 of the bottom of your loaf pan). Take out the fudge, carefully wrapped up, and place in the freezer or refrigerator until it has set up. In the freezer it only takes about 20- to 30 minutes.<br>Cut into small squares, and enjoy!
