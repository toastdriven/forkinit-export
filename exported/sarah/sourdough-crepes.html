                1 cup sourdough starter<br> 3 eggs, beaten<br> 2 tablespoons melted butter<br> 1/4 teaspoon salt<br> 1/4 to 1/2 cup milk (to thin batter)

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Heat a 10-inch skillet over medium heat. In a medium-size bowl combine all ingredients, slowly adding milk until the desired (thin) consistency is reached. Add some butter to the skillet once hot.<br>2. Pour 1/3 cup of the batter into the center of the pan. Pick up the pan and turn and tilt it to allow batter to spread in a circular motion. Cook for about one minute or until edges come away from pan. Flip and cook an additional minute or two.<br>3. Remove crepe from pan and repeat with remaining batter, adding butter to pan as needed. Serve with jam, berries, whipped cream, or syrup.
