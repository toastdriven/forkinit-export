            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Preheat your oven to 425°F. In a medium bowl beat eggs and add sourdough starter, milk, salt, and sugar or honey (if using). Whisk well until smooth.<br>Cut butter into tablespoons and place in a 12-inch cast-iron skillet. Place pan with butter into the hot oven for at least five minutes, or until butter is well-melted and pan is hot. Remove pan from oven, swirl butter around bottom and sides to coat. Quickly pour in batter and place back in oven.<br>3. Bake for 15 to 18 minutes or until puffed up all the way around. Try not to open the oven door until at least 15 minutes in order to prevent the pancake from not puffing up properly.<br>4. Serve right away as it will begin to deflate just after removing from the oven. Serve with syrup, powdered sugar, fruit, lemon juice, or any of your favorite toppings.
