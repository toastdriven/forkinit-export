            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Spray a 9 x 13 inch pan liberally until coated.<br>Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Separate eggs.<br>Beat egg yolks with 3/4 cup sugar on high speed until yolks are pale yellow. Stir in milk and vanilla. Pour egg yolk mixture over the flour mixture and stir very gently until combined.<br>Beat egg whites on high speed until soft peaks form. With the mixer on, pour in remaining 1/4 cup sugar and beat until egg whites are stiff but not dry.<br>Fold egg white mixture into the batter very gently until just combined. Pour into prepared pan and spread to even out the surface.<br>Bake for 35 to 45 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Turn cake out onto a rimmed platter and allow to cool.<br>Combine condensed milk, evaporated milk, and heavy cream in a small pitcher. When cake is cool, pierce the surface with a fork several times. Slowly drizzle all but about 1 cup of the milk mixture—try to get as much around the edges of the cake as you can.<br>Allow the cake to absorb the milk mixture for 30 minutes. To ice the cake, whip 1 pint heavy cream with 3 tablespoons of sugar until thick and spreadable.<br>Spread over the surface of the cake. Decorate cake with whole or chopped maraschino cherries. Cut into squares and serve.
