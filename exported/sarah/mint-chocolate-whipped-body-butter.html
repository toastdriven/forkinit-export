            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1/2 cup of cocoa butter<br>1/2 cup mango or shea butter (you can also substitute another 1/2 cup cocoa butter. It will be a smidge less “light” when whipped up!)<br>1/2 cup coconut oil (find coconut oil here)<br>1/2 cup of jojoba or a mild olive oil (almond oil can also be used but it will decrease shelf life because it is more vulnerable to oxidation)<br>1-2 teaspoons peppermint essential oil (depending on preference)<br>2 tablespoons pure cocoa powder (if you would prefer a “white chocolate” version that is not a bronzer, substitute arrowroot powder or non-GMO cornstarch)<br>2 teaspoons naturally derived vitamin E (optional)<br>

            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Prepare an ice bath by filling a large bowl with ice and fitting a smaller bowl inside. The inside bowl needs to be able to hold at least 4-5 cups of liquid.<br>Using a double boiler or a pot of boiling water with a smaller pot fitted inside, melt cocoa butter and mango butter over a low simmer.<br>Add coconut oil and melt until completely liquid.<br>Remove cocoa butter/coconut oil mixture from heat.<br>Measure 5 teaspoons of cocoa powder into a small bowl and gradually add several tablespoons of jojoba/almond/olive oil. Mix thoroughly and then add to cocoa butter/coconut oil mixture along with remaining jojoba/almond/olive oil.<br>Place mixture in chilled bowl (which should still be resting above the ice bowl) and allow to cool for 10 minutes.<br>Remove mixture from ice bath and whip until stiff peaks form. If after a few minutes it does not seem to be thickening return the bowl to the ice bath and whip there.<br>Store in an airtight jar – Amber or cobalt are best but a clear jar is fine if kept out of direct sunlight (which promotes oxidation).<br><br>Note:<br>This recipe contains no preservatives, but the oils and butters themselves have been selected because they are naturally antimicrobial. Cold-pressed, high quality oils are recommended as lower quality oils can go rancid quickly. Assuming quality oils are used this body butter can be expected to stay fresh at room temp between 3-6 months without the optional Vitamin E. With the Vitamin E it can stay fresh for up to a year. Always use clean hands when scooping out a little whipped decadence!<br><br>If this butter is stored in a very warm environment it will melt. No fear, though, just chill and re-whip into decadent body care goodness!
