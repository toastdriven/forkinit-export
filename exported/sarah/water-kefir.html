                3-4 Tbs. Water Kefir Grains<br>Â¼ cup sugar per quart of water (I like organic unprocessed Rapadura sugar) Do not use honey!!<br>Non-chlorinated filtered water (If you use reverse osmosis, consider adding a few drops of trace minerals back in or sticking a rinsed pastured egg shell in for minerals) If you just have tap water, boil it to remove chlorine and cool before using

            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Dissolve the sugar in small amount of hot water.<br>When sugar is dissolved, fill the rest of the jar with cool filtered water and make sure the water is not warm- it must be at room temp!<br>Add the hydrated water kefir grains<br>Cover with towel, cheesecloth, or coffee filter and rubber band to keep out insects or small children.<br>Leave on the counter (preferably at 70-75 degrees) for 24-48 hours. The longer you leave it, the more sugar ferments out, so if you ware limiting carbs, I recommend 48 hours. Don&#x27;t leave longer than this! It can starve the grains!<br>After 48 hours, strain the water kefir grains through a bamboo or mesh strainer (don&#x27;t use metal if you can help it!) pouring the liquid into another container. I use a half gallon jar for the first process and strain into two quart size jars.<br>Restart the process by dissolving more sugar in water, adding cool water and adding Water Kefir Grains.<br>To make the Water Kefir carbonated, pour a couple ounces of fruit juice into the strained water kefir you just strained. I&#x27;ve found Grape, Pomegranate, Apple and Cherry to work the best. I don&#x27;t recommend citrus for this part, as it makes stringy yeast like things that are not tasty!<br>Once you&#x27;ve added the juice, cover the jars tightly with an air tight lid and leave on the counter an additional 1-3 days before drinking or refrigerating.<br>Repeat the process!<br><br>Other flavors for second ferment (per quart):<br>1/2 cup grape or apple juice<br>1/4 cup raisins or a few prunes (makes a Dr. Pepper like taste)<br>1/2 cup fresh fruit like mango, berries, etc (just not citrus or pineapple)<br>1 teaspoon of vanilla and 3-4 prunes or dates (makes a cream soda flavor)<br>a small piece of fresh ginger and 1/4 cup apple juice<br>strawberries and then a splash of lime juice right before serving<br>Lemon juice right before serving<br>Mix with iced tea right before serving<br>
