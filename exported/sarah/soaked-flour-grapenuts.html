                3 1/2  c. freshly ground whole wheat pastry (soft) flour<br>2 c. kefir, divided<br>1/2 c. sucanat<br>1 tsp. soda<br>1/2 tsp. sea salt

            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Night Before:<br><br>Mix the flour with 1 1/2 c. kefir til flour is moistened.  The dough will still be pretty dry.  Cover and let sit overnight.<br><br>Next morning:<br><br>Preheat oven to 350.  Add remaining 1/2 c. kefir, sucanat, soda and salt to soaked dough.  Mix until all is incorporated.  Spread on baking sheets and bake until starting to brown around the edges.<br><br><br>After baking, before whizzing<br>Let cool slightly, then break up into big chunks and whiz about a cupful at a time in the food processor.  If you know what commercial Grape Nuts look like, these will look very similar, but not as uniform.  It doesn’t matter if you have some slightly bigger chunks because they don’t get as crunchy so they won’t threaten to break your teeth.<br><br><br>After whizzing, before crisping<br>The original recipe says to return to pans and bake at 250 degrees until crisp, about 30 minutes.  This usually takes longer for me.  Sometimes I just leave it in the oven overnight with the light on to finish crisping.<br><br>Store in airtight containers
