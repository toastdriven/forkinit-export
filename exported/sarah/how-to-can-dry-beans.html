            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. Decide how many pints or quarts of beans you’d like to can. As a general rule, you’ll need a scant 1/2 cup of beans per pint and a scant 1 cup of beans per every quart. (1 pint is equivalent to 1 can of store-bought beans.)<br><br>2. Once you know how much of each legume you need for how much you want to can, measure and soak each variety of legume overnight for 12 to 24 hours. (I soak them in the jar it will be canned in) This soaking period pre-digests the beans for you, which makes them easier on the tummy for those who are sensitive to legumes. <br><br>3. Once your legumes have been properly soaked, it’s time to start the canning. Fill each pint or quart jar 1/3-2/3 of the way full with soaked legumes. (If you soaked in the jar the measurement is already correct) If you prefer salted beans, add 1/2 teaspoon sea salt per pint or 1 teaspoon sea salt per quart. Garlic, spices, ham, etc can also be added at this time. <br><br>4. Bring a small sauce pan of water to a simmer. Remove from heat and add the canning lids. Cover the pot to keep the lids hot.<br><br>5. Bring a kettle of water to boil. Using this water, fill the waiting jars with boiling water, leaving 1-inch head space free. Clean the rim, top each jar with a hot lid, then add a band and screw closed.<br><br>6. Put jars into the pressure canner. Following the manufacturer’s directions, bring the pot up to 10 pounds* pressure. Process pints for 75 minutes or quarts 90 minutes at 10 pounds* pressure.<br><br>7. Let canner’s pressure reduce. Transfer jars from canner to a clean counter lined with a towel. Let jars cool completely, then check all lids for a proper seal. Store. (Put any jars that do not seal in the fridge and consume within a few days.)<br><br>*Adjust the pressure to 15 pounds if your altitude is above 1,000 feet.
