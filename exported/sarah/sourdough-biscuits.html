            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                At least 7 hours before you wish to bake the biscuits, prepare the dough for a long fermentation. Start by cutting the fat into the flour until it is in small pieces. Stir in the starter, sweetener, and milk until a soft dough just comes together. Cover and place in a warm spot in your kitchen for 7 to 12 hours.<br>2. Preheat oven to 400°F. When ready to begin baking, combine salt, baking powder, and baking soda in a very small bowl until evenly mixed. Sprinkle this over the fermented dough and knead until it comes together into a cohesive, soft mass.<br>3. Roll the dough out to 1/2 inch thick. Cut with 2- to 3-inch biscuit cutter and place the biscuits in a 10-inch oven-proof skillet, one next to another.<br>4. Place the skillet in the hot oven and bake 20 to 30 minutes, or until golden brown on the top and bottom. Serve hot with butter or drippings.
