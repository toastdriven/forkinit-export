            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                6 c. all purpose flour (freshly ground is best)<br>2 t. salt<br>2/3 c. lard (traditional) OR olive oil<br>2 c. warm water - not boiling

            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Combine flour, salt and lard in a large bowl until crumbly using a pie crust cutter.<br>Add water gradually until dough can be gathered into a ball (you may not need all of the water- you want a semi-soft but not runny dough)<br>Knead until smooth and elastic.<br>Cover and rest at room temperature at least 30 minutes or up to 2 hours.<br>Divide dough into 25 balls rolling them between your hands to form a ball.<br>Roll each ball into a circle approximately 8&quot; round.  You may layer them between plastic wrap if you want to roll them all out before you begin cooking, or you can roll the next one while one or two are cooking (it is difficult to keep more than two pans cooking with only one person rolling).<br><br>To cook:<br>Heat a heavy skillet, griddle or comal over medium-high heat until thoroughly heated through.  <br>Place a tortilla in pan and cook 30 sec - 1 minute per side.  <br>Remove while still soft enough to fold with golden brown speckles on both sides.<br>Can be cooled and stored up to 3 days.
