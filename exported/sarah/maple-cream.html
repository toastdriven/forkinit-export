                2 cups fancy grade-A pure maple syrup<br>1/4 teaspoon milk, cream or butter*<br>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Prepare an ice water bath: Fill a large bowl with a 1/2 inch of water and ice. Pour the maple syrup into a small, high-sided saucepan and stir in the milk, cream or butter.<br>Set a candy thermometer in the syrup and place the pan over medium heat.<br>Cook, without stirring, until the temperature reaches 232 degrees F., about 10 minutes.<br>Remove the saucepan from the heat. Pour the maple syrup into a cold, clean saucepan placed in the ice bath. Do not move or disturb the cream in any way while the syrup cools: If the maple syrup is jiggled, the cream won&#x27;t form properly. Let stand, adding ice as needed to the ice water bath, until the syrup radiates a gentle warmth to the back of your hand when held about 1 inch above or a candy thermometer measures 140 degrees F.<br>Once the mixture reaches the correct temperature, use a wooden spoon to slowly stir the mixture until it forms a light color and thickens to the consistency of peanut butter, about 12 minutes.<br>Working quickly, transfer the maple cream to a jar or plastic container. Store, covered in the refrigerator, for up to 6 months, or in the freezer up to a year.<br>*In place of the milk, cream or butter, a 1/4 teaspoon of vegetable oil may be added to the maple syrup or rubbed around the rim of the saucepan to prevent the maple syrup from boiling over on the stove.
