            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Remove outer leaves and rinse cabbage.<br>Shred cabbage as for coleslaw or larger.<br>Put cabbage into the bowl and sprinkle with salt, mixing well to salt all of the cabbage.<br>Cover leave sit for at least an hour to draw the juices out.<br>Use a mallet to press the cabbage (do not pound to bruise the cabbage as it will get mushy)<br>Spoon into canning jars or gallon jars pressing down tightly as you go.  The liquid should rise over the top of the cabbage.  Leave at least 2 inches or more space at the top of the jar.<br>Mark the date (sharpie markers on glass work well) and set aside to ferment on the counter.<br>Check at least once per day to be sure cabbage is still submerged, if not, press down again.<br>Soon the contents will become bubbly and begin to smell like sauerkraut.<br>Depending on the climate, it may be done in as little as three days or up to a week or more (larger jars seem to take a little longer as well)  The liquids will swell up, oftentimes overflowing the jars, and several days later subside back down.  This indicates the main fermentation is done.  <br>When cabbage is slightly soft but still crunchy and tastes delightfully sour, transfer jars to refrigerator where they will keep for many months - if they last that long!  The flavor improves with age.
