            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Mix sugar and milk in heavy-bottomed saucepan. <br>Stirring often, gently bring to a simmer. As soon as steam starts lifting off the milk, lower heat.  Lower heat as far as possible once sugar is completely dissolved. <br>Allow to reduce to about half stirring occasionally. <br>Once reduced to your satisfaction whisk in butter and vanilla. <br>Cool before using in most recipes. <br><br>*a slow cooker can be used if it can be set really low. Stir more often. <br>**refrigerate and use up to 4 months
