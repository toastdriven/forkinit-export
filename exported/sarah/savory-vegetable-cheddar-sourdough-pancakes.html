            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                In a large bowl beat eggs. Use a box grater to grate carrots, cabbage, onion, and cheese right over eggs. Add salt, pepper, garlic powder, and paprika and mix well.<br>2. Pour starter over contents of bowl and mix just to combine. Let stand five minutes.<br>3. Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add 3 tablespoons of cooking fat<br>and allow to melt and heat up.<br>4. Once skillet is well-heated, ladle 1/3 cup portions into hot fat to fry pancakes. Fry for<br>3 to 5 minutes or until they are browned and can flip easily. Cook through on the other side. Serve with salsa, a creamy, tart sauce, and a salad.
