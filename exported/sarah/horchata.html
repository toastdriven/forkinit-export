                3 C. uncooked white rice<br>3 qts. filtered water <br>4 sticks of cinnamon <br>2 star anise pods (optional)<br>5 cloves (optional)<br>3 C. whole raw milk or coconut milk <br>4 tsp. vanilla extract <br>1 C. honey<br>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Pour about half the water and all the rice into a blender, being sure not to overfill your carafe. Blend for one minute.<br><br>Pour this blended rice water into a gallon-sized pitcher or glass jar. Add the remaining water, cinnamon sticks, anise, and cloves and let stand at room temperature overnight, covered. (You could feasibly let it sit for as little as three hours, but the flavor won’t be nearly as awesome!)<br><br>Strain the rice water into the serving vessel. A double fine mesh strainer works well. <br><br>Stir in the remaining ingredients. If you’re going for authenticity, try it with the whole milk. If you need to be dairy-free, opt for the coconut milk. Be sure to stir until the honey is well dissolved.<br><br>Before serving, let it chill in the fridge. Horchata is traditionally served over ice in the summer; in the very least it’s always refrigerated. That said, my family takes heretical glee in enjoying horchata served warm in the winter.
