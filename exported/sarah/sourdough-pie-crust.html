            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Combine the flour, salt, and sugar in a large bowl. Cut in the fat using a pastry cutter or your fingertips. The dough will eventually look like it has “peas” in it.<br>2. Gradually pour the starter in, a little bit at a time, until it just comes together. Depending on the humidity and the water content of your fat this may be less or more than 1 cup.<br>3. Once dough barely comes together gather it up in the bowl into a cohesive mass and cover it with plastic wrap or a plate. Leave it in a warm place for at least 7 hours to culture.<br>After the seven hours is up, or when you are ready to use your pie crust, transfer it to a freezer or refrigerator. This is crucial, as having cold fat in the dough will aid in creating a flaky pie crust.<br>5. Once the crust is very cold you can remove it, roll it out, and bake it into a pie with your favorite fillings.<br>Makes a top and bottom crust.
