                12-ounce package fresh cranberries<br> 3/4 cup sugar<br> 8-ounce can crushed pineapple, undrained<br> 2 cups mini marshmallows (optional)<br>1/4 cup chopped walnuts (optional)<br> 4 ounces cream cheese, softened<br> 2 cups heavy whipping cream

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                In a food processor (you can use a blender or by hand, also), pulse until the cranberries are coarsely chopped. I don&#x27;t like really large pieces so I chop them until they are somewhat finely chopped without turning to complete mush.<br>Add the sugar and pineapple, pulse once or twice, and pour into a container - cover and refrigerate for at least an hour to let the flavors blend.<br>Strain out the excess juice. <br>Stir in the marshmallows and/or walnuts.<br>In a medium bowl, beat the cream cheese until smooth. Pour in the cream and whip until stiff peaks form. Fold the creamy mixture into the salad.<br>Cover and refrigerate for four hours or up to overnight. It tastes best, in my opinion, if it has at least 8 hours to hang out before serving.
