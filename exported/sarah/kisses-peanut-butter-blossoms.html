            <h3 class="underline">Ingredients</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                48 Hershey Kisses Chocolates <br>1/2 Cup Shortening (I use butter, but you can also do 1/4 Cup shortening and 1/4 cup butter)<br>3/4 Cup creamy peanut butter (I also like using 1/2 of this amount with crunchy peanut butter and 1/2 creamy, but not necessary)<br>1/3 Cup granulated sugar<br>1/3 Cup packed light brown sugar<br> <br>1 egg<br>2 TBLS milk<br>1 tsp vanilla extract<br> <br>1 -1/2 Cups flour<br>1 tsp baking soda (I use baking powder if you are going to chill the dough and make cookies later)<br>1/2 tsp salt<br><br>Granulated sugar (for rolling in)
            </p>
        </div>

            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Preheat oven 375Â°  Remove Foil from Kisses (this needs to be done ahead because you have to quickly put the kisses into hot cookies)<br> <br>Beat shortening and peanut butter until well blended. <br>    Add granulated sugar and brown sugar; beat until fluffy.<br>    Add egg, milk and vanilla; beat well.<br> <br>    Stir together flour, soda and salt; gradually beat into peanut butter          mixture. <br> <br>Shape dough into 1-inch balls. Roll in granulated sugar; place on  un-greased cookie sheets (I use parchment paper)<br> <br>Bake 8-10 minutes or until lightly browned. IMMEDIATELY press a chocolate into center of each cookie; cookie will crack around edges.<br>    Remove from cookie sheet to wire rack and allow to cool completely.
