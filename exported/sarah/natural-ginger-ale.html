            <h3 class="underline">Ingredients</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                A 1-2 inch piece of fresh ginger root, minced. Adjust this to taste. I use 2 inches as I prefer a stronger ginger taste.<br>½ cup of organic sugar or rapadura sugar. if using plain sugar, add 1 tablespoon molasses for flavor and minerals.<br>½ cup fresh lemon or lime juice<br>½ tsp sea salt or himalayan salt<br>8 cups of filtered (chlorine free) water (Here is the water filter we use)<br>½ cup homemade ginger bug (or can use ¼ cup whey for a faster recipe though the flavor won&#x27;t be quite as good. Here is a tutorial for how to make whey)

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Make a &quot;wort&quot; for your ginger ale by placing 3 cups of the water, minced ginger root, sugar (and molasses if needed), and salt in a saucepan and bringing to a boil.<br>Simmer the mixture for about five minutes until sugar is dissolved and mixture starts to smell like ginger.<br>Remove from heat and add additional water. This should cool it but if not, allow to cool to room temperature before moving to the next step.<br>Add fresh lemon or lime juice and ginger bug (or whey).<br>Transfer to a 2 quart glass mason jar with a tight fitting (air-tight) lid. Stir well and put lid on.<br>Leave on the counter for 2-3 days until carbonated and transfer to the fridge where it will last indefinitely.<br>Watch this step carefully. Using whey will cause it to ferment more quickly and it will take less time. It should be bubble and should &quot;hiss&quot; like a soda when the lid is removed. This is very temperature dependent and the mixture may need to be burped or stirred during this fermentation time on the counter.<br>As with any traditional fermented drink, it is more of an art than a science as it depends on the strength of your culture, the temperature of your house and the sugar used. The final mixture should smell of ginger and slightly of yeast/fermentation and should be fizzy. Watch carefully that it doesn&#x27;t become too carbonated as this will cause too much pressure and may result in an exploding jar!<br>The mixture can be strained and transferred to Grolsch style bottles before putting in the fridge.<br>Strain before drinking.<br>Enjoy!<br>
