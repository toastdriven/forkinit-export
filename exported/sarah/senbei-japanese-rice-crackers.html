            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                3/4 cup sweet rice flour (such as Bob&#x27;s Red Mill Sweet Rice Flour)<br>1/3 cup cooked white rice<br>1/4 teaspoon sea salt<br>2 tablespoons canola oil<br>4 tablespoons water<br>5 teaspoons furikake- Japanese seaweed rice seasoning condiment<br>1 tablespoon aged soy sauce<br>1 tablespoon tupelo honey

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a food processor, combine the rice flour, white rice, salt, and oil. Pulse until finely ground. With the machine running, slowly add the water. Transfer to a bowl, add the furikake, and knead to combine. <br><br>Press hazelnut-sized balls of the dough between 2 ziplock bags into 2 1/2-inch disks (I use a flat-bottom brulee dish); the dough will be very thin. Bake on rimmed baking sheets for 5 minutes. Flip the crackers with a spatula and continue to cook until they are dry and starting to brown, 4 to 5 more minutes. Remove from oven. Turn off oven..<br><br>Combine the soy sauce and honey in a small bowl. Microwave for 25 seconds. Brush the tops of each cracker with the soy mixture. Place crackers in turned off oven and allow them to dry for 3 minutes. Allow crackers to cool for 15 minutes; they will crisp up considerably. Store in airtight container.
