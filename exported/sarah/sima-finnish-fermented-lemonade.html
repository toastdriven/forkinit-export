                14 cups water<br>1 cup brown sugar<br>1 cup plus 4 teaspoons sugar, divided<br>2 lemons (organic, if possible), washed and very thinly sliced<br>1/8 teaspoon yeast<br>20 raisins

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                In a large pot, bring the water to a boil. Add the brown sugar, 1 cup of the white sugar and stir to dissolve. Add the lemon slices, stir and let sit until lukewarm. Transfer the liquid to a nonreactive (non-metallic) container and add the yeast and stir. Partially cover and let sit for 8 hours or overnight. Tiny bubbles should have formed around the perimeter of the liquid.<br>Strain the liquid into sterilized bottles. Place one teaspoon of sugar per quart of liquid as well as 4-5 raisins. Cork tightly. Let stand at room temperature until the raisins have all risen to the top of the bottles. I left it two more days until I could tell it was very fizzy. SAFETY NOTE: Be sure to open the bottles AT LEAST once a day to release the pressure so the bottles don’t burst.<br>Refrigerate until use, letting out some of the pressure from the bottles from time to time, if necessary (I didn’t actually find this part to be necessary, as once I refrigerated it the fermentation stopped)
