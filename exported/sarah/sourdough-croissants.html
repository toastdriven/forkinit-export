            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Make the sponge:<br><br>Mix the sponge ingredients well and allow the sponge to stand, covered and in a warm place, for 3 hours or until it has expanded to 2 cups.<br><br>Start chilling the butter:<br><br>Dust one sheet of the paper with 1 tablespoon of flour. Slice the butter into pieces 1/4 inch thick, placing them closely next to each other to form a square. Dust with the second tablespoon of flour.<br><br>Place the second sheet of paper on top of the butter and roll it, forcing the butter into a rectangle about 9″ x 9″ (23 cm x 23 cm). Put the butter, between its two sheets, in the fridge for 1 hour.<br><br>It’s a good idea to follow the dimensions suggested in this recipe, to make 12 even-sized croissants. I actually took a steel ruler and measured everything as I went along.<br><br>Make the dough:<br><br>Into the starter, mix the dough ingredients.<br><br>Knead on a floured surface, adding up to 3/4 cup more flour to get a light, kneadable dough. The original recipe says up to 1/4 cup more flour, but either that’s a typo or the quality of my Israeli flour is very different, because it took 3/4 cup added flour to get a dough that stayed together.<br><br>Cover the dough and chill it in the fridge for 1/2 hour.<br><br>Roll the dough and butter together:<br><br>Flour your working surface heavily. Keep extra flour handy for rolling at all times from now on.<br><br>Place the cold dough on your floured surface and roll it out into a 15″ x 10″ (38 cm x 25.4 cm) rectangle.<br><br>Use the edge of your ruler, or your hand, to push the dough into the desired dimensions with straight edges. It makes a difference, when you cut the dough into triangles later.<br><br>Cut the butter in half. Put one half of the butter across the center one-third of the dough.<br><br>Fold one end of the dough over the butter. Place the other half of butter on top of it.<br><br>Fold the last third of the dough over the butter. This makes a package of dough-butter-dough-butter-dough. It should be about 10″ x 5″ (25.4 cm x 12.7 cm). Pinch the edges together so that no butter shows. If the dough tears, exposing the butter, pinch a tiny piece off the dough and smooth it on over the tear.<br><br>Roll out the dough into a rectangle 10″ x 5″ (25.4 cm x 38 cm). Chill it in the fridge for at least an hour.<br><br>After the hour, repeat the last step, not adding any more butter, just rolling it out to 10&quot; x 15&quot; (25.4 cm x 38 cm), folding into thirds, rolling it out and folding again. Chill the dough another hour. Or, as I did, wrap the dough up in plastic wrap and let it rest overnight in the fridge.<br><br>Shape the croissants:<br><br>Line two shallow baking pans with baking paper and grease the paper lightly by rubbing a stick of butter over it.<br><br>Flour your work surface again and cut the dough into six 5″ x 5″ (12.7 cm x 12.7 cm) squares. Cut each square diagonally to make 12 triangles 5″ x 5″ x 7″ (12.7 cm x 12.7 cm x 18 cm). Roll each triangle out to 1/8″ (about 1 cm) thickness, staring from the longest side to the point.<br><br>Starting at the longest side, roll it up tightly. Turn it so that the point is underneath the roll. Bend both ends to make them curl toward the middle, making a crescent. Place the croissants on the baking pans and let them rise in a warm place for 1 hour.<br><br>Bake:<br><br>Glaze the croissants with an egg beaten with 1 tablespoon milk and 1 tablespoon sugar.<br><br>Preheat the oven to 375° F (190° C). Bake the croissants for 20 minutes, then turn the oven off and let them sit in there for another 10 minutes before removing them. They should be golden-brown, with a gently crisp crust and a tender crumb.<br>
