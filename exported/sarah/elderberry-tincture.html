                1 lb. dried elderberries or two cups fresh (take out any stems or plant material)<br>1/2 cup raw honey<br>optional â€“ herbs like rose hips, cinnamon, ginger, and elder flower (I like to use a Tablespoon of each)<br>80 proof non-gmo vodka such as Absolut, Grey Goose or any organic

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Fill each quart size mason jar approx 1/2 full with dried elderberries, this should come out to about one pound. For fresh elderberries fill the jar about 2/3 of the way.<br>Add honey and additional herbs as desired. Possible quantities: two cinnamon sticks, 1 tsp. elder flowers, 1/2 cup of rose hips, 1 inch ginger root.<br>Fill the rest of the jar with vodka, leaving a bit of head space.<br>Place the cover on the jar, label with contents and date, and store in a cool, dark space.<br>On the first day, check to see if you need to add more vodka after the herbs absorb some of it. Shake gently each day for at least seven days, but preferably 4 weeks. <br>Strain out the berries, and pour tincture into dark colored bottles.<br>My dosage: 1 dropper (1/4 tsp.) for prevention. Several times per day at onset of a cold.
