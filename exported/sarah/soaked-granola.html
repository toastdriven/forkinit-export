            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                STEP ONE SOAKING:<br>Place butter and coconut oil in a small sauce pan and heat until melted. Pour into a very large ceramic (or glass) mixing bowl and add pure *coconut milk, water and vinegar; whisk to combine.<br>Add oats and rye flakes (or buckwheat groats); thoroughly combine using a large wooden spoon or rubber spatula.<br>Cover the bowl and place it in a warm area of your kitchen for 24-30 hours.<br>(*Please note: I do not recommend using coconut milk beverages, i.e. Silk or So Delicious brands as they contain potentially harmful additives. Instead, I recommend and use pure unsweetened canned coconut milk.)<br>Once oat mixture is finished soaking, you&#x27;re ready for STEP TWO: BAKING.<br><br>GF Option: If you&#x27;re gluten-free you can use ground buckwheat groats for the soak. You can decrease the amount to 1 cup of ground buckwheat groats and then use 7 cups of GF rolled oats. The reason you need rolled rye or ground buckwheat groats is because they contain the phytase necessary to help break down the high levels of phytic acid in oats. Oats do not contain much phytase so soaking them without a phytase booster (like rolled rye, or ground buckwheat groats for those who are GF) doesn&#x27;t do much to reduce the phytic acid.<br><br>STEP TWO BAKING:<br>After soaking time is completed, preheat oven to 200° F. Place honey, maple syrup, salt, cinnamon, and vanilla in a glass measuring cup, Use a small rubber spatula or whisk to blend together until well combined.<br>Pour the honey mixture over the soaked oats. Using large rubber spatula, combine the honey and oat mixtures, until well combined. (Tip: As shown in the step-by-step “Soaked Granola Photo Tutorial,” I start working at the edges to pull the soaked granola forward and allow the honey mixture to seep down. Then I keep pressing the soaked oats down using the top of rubber spatula, while turning the oats over and over, until everything is well incorporated.)<br>Spread the mixture out over two parchment paper-lined, 12x17-inch rimmed-baking sheets. Place baking sheets side-by-side in oven for best results. If you have to stack them, be sure to rotate them during bake time. Bake for 8 hours, turning the granola every two-hours (be sure to see tip for ensuring crispy granola below). Then turn off oven and allow to sit in warm oven overnight until completely cooled.<br>Remove cooled granola from the oven and mix in any “add-ins” you’d like (see suggestions above). Makes 10-cups of granola (without add-ins).<br>I recommend storing half in an airtight container in the pantry and the other half in a freezer-safe container in the freezer to preserve crispness.<br>Serve with chilled raw milk, whole milk yogurt or simply enjoy it as a delicious snack!<br><br>Tips for crispy, non-clumpy granola: If is very important that after two hours in the oven, you remove the baking sheets from the oven and use a large spatula to break up the large flat of granola into small sections by flipping over the granola in small sections. Then use the spatula to break-up the moist granola sections into smaller pieces for faster cooking/drying time. Place back in oven and bake for an additional two hours. Then again, remove the baking sheets from oven and repeat the process; flipping over and breaking the granola pieces into smaller sections. Keep repeating this process every two hours thereafter, getting the pieces smaller and smaller each time. When granola is mostly crisp (usually after 8 hours baking), carefully remove the parchment paper, leaving the granola on the baking sheet. Then, turn off the oven and leave the granola inside the oven with the oven door closed until completely cooled. The granola will get slightly crispier as it cools.<br><br>STEP THREE ADD-INS:<br>• Tropical Delight Granola ­– Add the following to your baked granola: Crispy almond slices, chopped dried pineapple pieces, chopped dried mango pieces and shredded coconut.<br>• Apple Pie Granola – Add the following to your baked granola: Crispy almond slices, crispy chopped pecans, chopped dried apple pieces and raisins.<br>• Cranberry-Walnut Granola – Add the following to your baked granola: Crispy almond slices, crispy chopped walnuts and dried cranberries.<br>Add-In Ideas (Choose any or all of the following to create your own delicious granola creations!)<br>• Your favorite unsweetened dried fruit, such as raisins, currants, cranberries, cherries, blueberries, apricots, apples, etc.<br>• Dried shredded coconut (or coconut flakes)<br>• Your favorite chopped *crispy nuts, such as almonds, pecans or walnuts<br>• Your favorite seeds, such as chia, flax, sunflower or pumpkin
