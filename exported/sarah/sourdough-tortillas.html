                1/2 cup 100% hydration sourdough starter<br> 1/2 cup milk or water<br> 4 tablespoons melted lard, bacon grease, or coconut oil (lard is traditional)<br> 1 teaspoon sea salt<br> 2 cups (plus more, as needed) whole wheat flour (hard wheat is better than soft as it<br>contains a bit more gluten and holds together better when rolling out)

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Combine starter, milk, salt, and melted fat in a medium bowl. Stir in flour, 1/2 cup at a time, until you hit two cups.<br>2. At this point determine whether your dough needs more flour. You are looking for a dough that is slightly sticky, but not so moist that it is messy. You will be kneading on a floured surface so don’t add too much flour.<br>Add flour until desired texture is achieved. Plop out onto a floured surface and knead for about three minutes.<br>4. Cover and place in a warm location in your kitchen for 8 to 24 hours to ferment.<br>5. When ready to cook tortillas divide dough into eight pieces. Roll each into a small ball and place back into covered bowl. Remove balls from container one at a time<br>and roll them out on a floured work surface until desired thickness is reached.<br>6. Carefully transfer tortilla to a hot griddle that has been heating over medium-high heat. Cook for about 30 seconds, or until bubbles begin to form and the edges firm<br>up.<br>7. Flip and finish cooking another 30 seconds.<br>8. Serve hot or cool and store to eat for a few days. The sourdough helps to keep the<br>tortillas soft and fresh for a longer time than non-sourdough tortillas.
