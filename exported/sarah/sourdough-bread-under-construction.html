            I&#x27;m experimenting with sourdough bread. Here I have tweaked a recipe with hard-to-remember amounts I found online and will probably alter measurements as I find what works best for me.  At this point I am using half whole wheat and half white flour, but hope to be able to increase the whole wheat and still produce a fluffy loaf.  I&#x27;m including the instructions for making free form round loaves, but you could also use bread pans.

            <h3 class="underline">Ingredients</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1 1/2 cups sourdough starter (I am using a starter fed with half white flour and half aged whole wheat flour)<br>4 cups water<br>~10 cups flour (1/2 freshly ground whole wheat and 1/2 white)<br>2 tablespoons salt
            </p>
        </div>

            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Combine starter, water and 6 cups of flour until smooth.<br>Add flour gradually until dough is stiff enough to hold its form well.<br>Let sit 20 minutes.<br>Add salt and knead.<br>Let raise in a warm place until double.<br>Shape loaves and place in bannetons (my makeshift bannetons consist of baskets and bowels lined with smooth towels that have been rubbed full of rice flour) <br>Cover (with plastic bags) and place loaves in refrigerator or cold room overnight. <br>In the morning move loaves to a warm place and let finish rising until about double.<br>1/2 hour before ready to bake, preheat oven to 375 with a pizza stone on the rack.<br>To bake, gently dump the loaf onto the hot stone, slash top with a razor blade  and cover with an upside-down pan of some sort.  Bake 30 minutes, remove covering pan and bake an additional 15 minutes. If in doubt wether it is done the intertal temperature should be at least 190. <br>Repeat with the remaining loaves.<br>
