            Making soda crackers is easy, but takes a relatively long time.  The first rise allows the dough to increase in volume without developing a pronounced yeast flavor.  Since the dough will ferment to some extent dring this time, alkaline soda is added to neutralize the acids produced.  The dough is then allowed to rest to relax the gluten to the crackers will not be tough and chewy.

                In a small bowl, combine the yeast with the sugar and warm water.  Set aside until the yeast is fully dissolved, 5-10 minutes.  <br>Measure 3 1/2 c. of the flour into a large bowl. <br>Stir in the yeast mixture and mix well.<br>Cover and let the dough rest in a warm place for 20-30 hours.<br><br>After 20-30 hours have passed:<br>In a small bowl, dissolve the baking soda in the Tablespoon water.<br>Place the soda mixture, buttermilk, salt and butter in the bowl with the dough and mix well.<br>Mix in as much of the remaining 1/2 to 1 cup flour as necessary to form a stiff, nonsticky dough.<br>Knead for a minute or two and then let rest, covered, for 15 minutes.<br>On a lightly floured surface, knead the dough for another few minutes, until it is smooth and springy to the touch.  Place it in a large, clean, lightly oiled bowl and let it rest, covered, for another 3-4 hours.<br><br>After 3-4 hours have passed:<br>Preheat oven to 450<br>Punch dough down and knead a few strokes.<br>Divide into 3 equal portions for rolling.<br>Flatten with hands and begin rolling with a pin, on a floured surface or pastry cloth, beginning in the center.  The dough will roll more easily as it begins to relax again.<br>Roll to a rectangle approximately 1/4&quot; thick and position so the long edge runs horizontally in front of you.  <br>Fold the left third of the dough over the center third.  Likewise, fold the right third over the center.  The dough is now in 3 layers with the seam running vertically.<br>Give the dough a quarter turn so the seam runs horizontally and repeat steps 5-7.<br>For the final rolling, roll the dough to 1/16&quot; - 1/8&quot; thick.<br>Sprinkle with salt and lightly roll over with the pin so it doesn&#x27;t fall off.<br>With a sharp knife, cut into 2-inch squares and place on an ungreased baking sheet.<br>Prick with a fork. <br>Bake 8 minutes.<br>Turn and bake 1-3 minutes, or until lightly browned.<br>Cool on a rack.
