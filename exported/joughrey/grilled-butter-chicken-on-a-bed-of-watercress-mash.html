            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                First make the watercress butter:<br>Place all the ingredients in a bowl and mix together with a fork. Season with plenty of freshly ground black pepper and reserve, keeping at room temperature.<br><br>Cut the potatoes into large chunks. Place in a pan of lightly salted water, cover with a lid and bring to a boil. Simmer for 10-15 minutes or until tender.<br><br>Drain, return to the pan and tip in the chopped watercress. REplace the lid and leave to stand for 1-2 minutes or until the watercress has wilted. Mash then add the yogurt or milk and butter. Fluff up with a fork, add the nutmeg and season to taste with ground black pepper. Reserve, keeping warm.<br><br>Meanwhile, gently push a little of the watercress butter under the skin of the chicken fillets.<br><br>Preheat a non-stick frying pan, and when hot, add the oil. Cook the chicken, skin-side down, for 10-15 minutes, turning once until the chicken is golden-brown on both sides and cooked through.<br><br>Heap the watercress mash in the center of four warmed plates and top with the chicken. Spoon the pan juices around and serve garnished with a sprig of watercress and a wedge of lemon.<br>
