                4 bone-in chicken breasts, (about 2 1/2 pounds), trimmed, skin removed<br>1/4 teaspoon salt, divided<br>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper, plus more to taste<br>2 teaspoons dried thyme, divided<br>1/4 cup red raspberry jelly<br>2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar<br>

            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                   1.  Preheat oven to 400Â°F. Line a baking sheet with foil and lightly oil or coat it with cooking spray.<br>   2. Season chicken on both sides with 1/8 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper, then rub with 1 1/2 teaspoons thyme. Place bone-side up in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. Roast for 15 minutes.<br>   3. Meanwhile, heat jelly, vinegar and the remaining 1/2 teaspoon thyme in a small saucepan over medium-low heat until the jelly is melted. Season with the remaining 1/8 teaspoon salt and pepper and remove from the heat.<br>   4. Turn the chicken meat-side up. Brush liberally with the jelly glaze. Continue to roast, brushing twice with the remaining glaze, until the chicken is cooked through, about 15 minutes more.
