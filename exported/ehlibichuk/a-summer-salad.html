            This is on my list of things to eat out of the serving bowl with a large spoon. It is very bad for you. It is also really easy and kind of obvious.

                Obviously doubling the recipe is fabulous. :) Cook noodles. Microwave vegetables. Stir in remaining ingredients, refrigerate at least 1 hour. Eat.  <br><br>PS: Vinegar and sugar quantities should be equivalent, no matter how much of them you add. Start with a teaspoon each.
