            We made this after having something similar at a local fusion restaurant. We were hooked, quite possibly for life. The recipe makes more spice mix than you&#x27;ll need. This is very intentional.

                Mix spice mix and store covered in a cool, dry place. Mix wet ingredients in a separate bowl. Put this in the fridge until showtime. <br><br>Shuck, clean, and grill your corn. When it is cool enough to handle, stick something in one end as a handle - a chopstick, two toothpicks, or one of those corn handle things. Paint the wet ingredients on with a pastry brush, then roll in a mix of the cheese and 2 tsp spice mix. Leave the handle in, and serve. <br><br>Next time, we may add some cornmeal for texture.
