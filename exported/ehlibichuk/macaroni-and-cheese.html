            This recipe is not hard. Anyone can make it, and it tastes good. However, for some reason it has come up as my specialty and my friends always ask for it. It freezes well.

                The only necessary cheeses are the cream cheese and cheddar. Otherwise I play around with what I have available, though my most common combination is listed. <br><br>Set macaroni to cook per directions on package. <br><br>Cube the bread. If you&#x27;re feeling extravagant, you can melt garlic butter and toss with bread.<br><br>In a hot pan, melt butter. Whisk n flour and garlic, saute until flour will not mix into butter any more. Add milk until sauce is thin. Add cheeses, swapping out for a spatula when whisking grows difficult. Mix in noodles and pour into baking dish. <br><br>Top with bread cubes and bake in a 350* oven until bread cubes are toasty brown.
