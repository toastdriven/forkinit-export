            This is a slightly altered risotto recipe based off of the ever-popular elote. Quadruple - or more! - the spice recipe and store what you don&#x27;t use. You won&#x27;t regret it. <br><br>It was named by my brother-in-law, who decided that since rice was chinese, risotto italian, and the spices mildly spanish, it was clearly spanianese. All culinary arguments about the origins of food could not sway him, and so spanianese it became.

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Arborio rice (I use 2 c for my family) <br>Cooked, diced chicken<br>1 box chicken stock (for up to 4 servings of rice)<br>Butter or olive oil<br>Queso Fresco<br><br>for the spices:<br>1 Tbsp sugar<br>1/2 Tbsp chili powder<br>1/2 Tbsp garlic powder<br>3/4 tsp ground red pepper<br>3/4 tsp cumin<br>1/4 tsp fresh ground black pepper<br>

            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Mix your spices together<br>Melt a small amount of butter or pour a small amount of olive oil into a hot pan. Pour in your arborio rice and cook for a few minutes, allowing it to get a nutty brown coating on it. Add chicken stock in splashes, stirring in each splash and allowing it to become &quot;dry&quot; again before adding more. This makes it creamy magically. Taste for doneness often. I find that it always takes a different amount of stock, but usually not more than a whole box. If it does, add water. <br><br>Add your seasoning liberally (You may need all of the listed amounts, you may not. Do be liberal, but if your family doesn&#x27;t like spicy don&#x27;t be crazy) and stir in the chicken. let that cook a minute and add crumbled queso fresco until it is cheesy enough for you. At least a half cup is mandatory, more is better. <br><br>Eat. Pepperjack would be an okay substitute, if you must.
