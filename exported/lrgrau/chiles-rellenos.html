            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Using a long handled fork, char chiles over an open flame, turning until skins are blackened, 4 to 6 minutes (alternatively, broil chiles on a broiler pan about 2 inches from heat, turning occasionally until skins are blistered and charred).  Transfer chiles to a bowl and let stand, covered, until cool enough to handle.  Using a small knife, carefully scrape the charred skin off the chiles, leaving the stems attached.  <br><br>Carefully cut a lengthwise slit into each chile to form a pocket, and cut out and discard the seeds.  Stuff each chile with some of the mild cheddar, and thread shut with a toothpick. In a large saucepan, melt enough shortening to reach 1/2 inch up the sides and heat to 375 degrees F on a deep fat thermometer.  <br><br>Preheat the broiler.  In a bowl, combine flour, salt, and pepper.  In another bowl, carefully fold yolks into egg whites.  Working in batches, dredge the chiles in the flour and, using a slotted spoon, dip into the eggs to coat completely.  Fry, turning occasionally, until golden, no more than a couple of minutes.  Using a slotted spoon, transfer chiles (careful, they are delicate) to a paper towel to drain. <br><br>Arrange chiles on a flame-proof plate and sprinkle with the sharp cheddar.  Broil chiles just long enough to melt cheese and serve immediately, accompanied by salsa, if desired.
