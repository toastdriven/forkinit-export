            No idea why it&#x27;s called this. But it may become my new favorite dessert. The chocolate cheesecake layer alone was enough to make it memorable... =)

            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Preheat oven to 350F. Grease a 10 inch springform pan with butter.<br><br>Spread the cookie dough into the bottom of the pan, making one big even cookie. It will be a little on the thin side, but don&#x27;t worry, there will be enough. Use a fork to tamp it down. Stick it in the freezer.<br><br>Mix the brownie mix and the cocoa powder together in big bowl with a whisk or large fork. Add the water, oil, eggs, and almond extract and mix together *just* until the dry ingredients are absorbed. Be careful not to over mix! The batter will be somewhat lumpy.<br><br>Remove the springform pan from the freezer and add the brownie batter right over the top. Bake for 34-38 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the brownie comes out *almost* clean -- just a few bits of brownie sticking to the toothpick is okay. You basically want it to where it&#x27;s not raw in the center and doesn&#x27;t jiggle when you shake the pan a bit. You want it just a tad bit less baked than you would a normal brownie.<br><br>Remove it from the oven and promptly sprinkle about a 1/3 cup of chocolate chips (from the 1 cup of chips listed above) over the top. Let it sit for a minute or two and once the chocolate chips are soft, evenly spread them over the top of brownie&#x27;s surface. Allow it to cool on the counter.<br><br>While the pie is cooling, microwave the remaining chocolate chips on low power (2 or 3) on 30 second intervals until the chips are melted, stirring well each time. Set aside. Cream the butter, and cream cheese together for 1 minute. Add the vanilla and stir again. Add the melted chocolate, one big teaspoonful at a time until it&#x27;s totally incorporated into the cream cheese. Spread the cream cheese mixture over the top of the pie and store it uncovered in the refrigerator for an hour. (Or overnight)<br><br>About an hour or two before you&#x27;re ready to serve the pie (or when it&#x27;s totally cooled off), whisk the whipping cream on high speed until soft peaks form. Add the vanilla and the powdered sugar and mix again until combined. Spread evenly over the top of the pie. Grate chocolate directly over the top, sprinkle chocolate curls, or embellish with chocolate sprinkles. Cover and put it back in the refrigerator for at least 1/2 an hour.<br><br>When you&#x27;re ready to serve, run a thin knife or spatula to around the edge of the pan to free it from the outside ring. Gently remove the ring and let it come to room temperature at least a half an hour before serving. You&#x27;ll know it&#x27;s ready to serve when you&#x27;re able to cut it from the center fairly easily.<br>
