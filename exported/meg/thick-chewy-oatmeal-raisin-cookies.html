            This is the best recipe for these I&#x27;ve ever used. Plus, it uses less sugar than most recipes! =)

                1/2 cup (1 stick or 4 ounces) butter, softened<br>2/3 cup light brown sugar, packed<br>1 egg<br>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract<br>3/4 cup all-purpose flour<br>1/2 teaspoon baking soda<br>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br>1/4 teaspoon salt <br>1 1/2 cups rolled oats<br>3/4 cup raisins<br>1/2 cup walnuts, chopped (optional)

            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).<br><br>In a large bowl, cream together the butter, brown sugar, egg and vanilla until smooth. <br>In a separate bowl, whisk the flour, baking soda, cinnamon and salt together. <br>Stir this into the butter/sugar mixture. Stir in the oats, raisins and walnuts, if using them.<br><br>At this point you can either chill the dough for a bit in the fridge and then scoop it, or scoop the cookies onto a sheet and then chill the whole tray before baking them. You could also bake them right away, if you want (I have), but I do find that they end up slightly less thick. However, still amazingly chewy. =)<br><br>The trick to getting a really thick, chewy cookie is to chill the dough before you bake it. You can scoop it and then chill it, or, if you like, scoop it, freeze them and store them in a freezer bag so you can bake them as you wish. They tend to be thicker when baked from the cold — only a couple extra minutes baking is needed.<br><br>The cookies should be two inches apart on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake them for 10 to 12 minutes (your baking time will vary, depending on your oven and how cold the cookies were going in), taking them out when golden at the edges but still a little undercooked-looking on top. Let them sit on the hot baking sheet for five minutes before transferring them to a rack to cool.<br>
