            Delicious recipe from a friend of mine. He altered a Food Network recipe as he didn&#x27;t have the &quot;family&quot; recipe. But, it was still amazing.

                Cook the butter over medium heat, whisking frequently, until the butter starts to brown and foam, about 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the onion, carrot, celery, sage, cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg, and cook until tender, stirring frequently, until tender. Stir in the garlic and cook an additional minute.<br><br>Stir together the half-and-half and cornstarch in a liquid measuring cup, and pour it into the pot, along with the chicken broth, pumpkin puree, brown sugar, salt and pepper. Bring to a boil over medium-low heat, stirring frequently. When the soup starts to thicken reduce the heat to low. Using an immersion blender, puree the soup until a smooth consistency is reached. Add broccoli and simmer until ready to serve.<br>
