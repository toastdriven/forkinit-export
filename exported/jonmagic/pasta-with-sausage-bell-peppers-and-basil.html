            (via The Bon Appetit Cookbook by Barbara Fairchild) Great for a casual dinner party, this recipe captures the appealing flavor combination of one of the all-time favorite street-festival sandwiches in New York&#x27;s Little Italy: sweet pork sausage, caramelized onions, and colorful strips of sauteed red bell pepper. Feel free to substitute Italian-style fresh turkey or chicken sausage, found at upscale butcher shops, Italian delicatessens, and the meat departments of many supermarkets.<br><br>My Note: This is my first time trying the recipe

                Divide oil between 2 heavy large skillets and heat over medium heat. Divide sausage between skillets; cook until brown, breaking up with the back of a fork, about 12 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer sausage to large bowl. Add onions to skillets dividing equally. Saute until golden, about 10 minutes. Add bell peppers to onions, dividing equally. Saute until tender, about 6 minutes. Pour 3/4 of a cup of wine into each skillet; boil 5 minutes to allow wine to evaporate slightly. Add vegetables to bowl with sausage.<br><br>Cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally. Drain pasta; return to same pot. Add sausage and vegetables; toss to combine. Mix in 1 1/2 cups of cheese. Add 1 1/2 cups of basil; toss to combine. Season pasta to taste with salt and pepper. Mound in bowl. Sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup of basil. Serve, passing additional cheese separately.
