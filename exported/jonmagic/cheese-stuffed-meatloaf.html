            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                2lb of hamburger<br>3 cloves of garlic minced<br>1/2 a medium onion finely chopped<br>1 egg<br>1/2 cup of bread crumbs<br>Cheese! whatever cheese you like, Cheddar, Monterey Jack, Mozzarella<br>some mushrooms! (in our case only in half the loaf)<br>1/2 cup of ketchup<br>1/2 tablespoon of mustard (whatever mustard you like)<br>1 1/2 tablespoons of worcestershire<br>1 teaspoon of honey<br>1/2 teaspoon of hot sauce

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Break the egg into a largish bowl, then toss in the meat and throw the bread crumbs, onions, and garlic into the bowl. Add a tablespoon of milk. Salt and pepper to season (she used a lot of pepper from our grinder).<br>Then its time to get dirty! Work the contents of the bowl with your hands, really dig in and mix it up.<br>Meanwhile saute the mushrooms for just a minute or two in some butter or oil, season with salt and pepper.<br>Now grease up a bread pan and start by putting enough meat in to come half way up side of the pan. Build a well to put the cheese in. Then throw some cheese down in the well, just a thin layer, and then throw the mushrooms down on half (for me!). Put the rest of the cheese in, and then encase with the rest of the meat. You now have a cheese and mushroom sarcophagus made from meat. Awesome.<br>Bake at 350 for 45 minutes to an hour (check it after 45).<br><br>For the glaze:<br>Combine the ketchup, mustard, worcestershire, honey, and hot sauce and mix it up real good.<br>Tweak the glaze to taste by adding more of whatever ingredient you want!
