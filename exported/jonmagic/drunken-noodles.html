            This is a dish I first had at our local Thai restaurant, and I have to say, I keep going back for more.<br><br>We&#x27;ve been getting a little more adventuresome in the kitchen with Asian recipes, so I figured I&#x27;d give this one a try. To prepare I&#x27;ve read about a dozen drunken noodles recipes and picked out the ingredients I like best. The cooking part is straight forward, a stir-fry, cooking the ingredients in the order of how long each one needs cooked.

                MOST IMPORTANT!!! Get all your ingredients together, once you start the stir-fry you won&#x27;t have time to be looking for anything. Prepare the ingredients using the instructions in the ingredient list.<br>Prepare the sauce by combining the fish sauce, mushroom soy sauce, sugar, vinegar, and lime juice in a bowl.<br>Heat your wok to medium/high heat and pour in some vegetable or peanut oil.<br>Toss in the pork and onion and stir-fry for 1 to 2 minutes.<br>Now add the garlic, chili&#x27;s, and shrimp and stir-fry for just a few seconds before adding the egg.<br>If you did not pre cook the egg in a separate skillet push the current stir-fry to the side and add the egg in the open space. Let it cook and begin to solidify, moving it bit by bit to help the extra egg liquid hit the hot pan and cook.<br>Now stir-fry everything together thats already in the pan (we&#x27;ve only been cooking for about 4 minutes now).<br>Add the sauce, then the chinese broccoli, then the rice noodles, and stir-fry for 2 or 3 minutes to combine everything, cook off some of the liquid (it should thicken a tiny bit).<br>Finally add the Thai basil and stir-fry for another 15 to 20 seconds, then remove from heat.<br>Serve immediately with whatever extras you like. My favorites are pickled jalapenos and chili sauce.
