                Drain the soaked beans and place them in a large, heavy bottom pan. Add the stock and bring to a boil. Partially cover the pan, then reduce the heat, and let simmer for 2 hours or until tender.<br><br>Transfer about half the beans and a little of the stock to a food processor or blender and process into a smooth puree. Return the puree to the pan and stir well to mix. Return the soup to a boil.<br><br>Add the pasta to the soup, return to a boil, and cook for 10 minutes, or until tender.<br><br>Meanwhile, heat 4 tbsp of the olive oil in a small pan. Add the garlic and cook over low heat, stirring frequently, for 4-5 minutes, or until golden. Stir the garlic into the soup and add the parsley. Season with salt &amp; pepper &amp; ladle into warmed soup bowls. Drizzle with the remaining olive oil and service immediately with crusty bread.
