            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                To make the tahini sauce, put the sesame seed paste and garlic in a bowl. Gradually stir in the water until a fairly smooth consistency is reached, then stir in the lemon juice. Add more water or lemon juice, if necessary. Cover with plastic wrap and let chill in the refrigerator until required.<br><br>To make the falafel, rinse and drain the beans and chick peas. Put them in a food processor with the onion, garlic, chile, baking powder, chopped parsley, and cayenne pepper. Process to a course paste, then add the water and season with salt &amp; pepper. Process again briefly.<br><br>Heat about 2 1/2 inches of oil in a deep fat fryer, large, heavy-bottom pan, or wok over high heat. Deep fry rounded tablespoonfuls of the mixture in batches for 2 to 2 1/2 minutes until golden and crispy on the outside. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain well on paper towels. Serve hot or cold, garnished with parsley sprigs and accompanied by the tahini sauce, pita bread, yogurt, and lemon wedges.
