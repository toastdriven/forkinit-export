                1 tablespoon canola oil<br>3 cloves garlic, chopped<br>1 2-pound head bok choy, trimmed and thinly sliced<br>4 cups sliced shiitake mushroom caps (9 ounces with stems)<br>2 tablespoons oyster-flavored or oyster sauce (see Note)<br>1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil<br>1/4 teaspoon salt<br>1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds (see Tip)

            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant but not browned, 30 seconds. Add bok choy and mushrooms; cook, stirring, until wilted, about 2 minutes. Continue cooking, stirring often, until just tender, 3 to 5 minutes more. Stir in oyster sauce, sesame oil and salt. Garnish with sesame seeds.<br><br>Note: Oyster sauce is a richly flavored condiment made from oysters and brine. Vegetarian oyster sauces substitute mushrooms for the oysters. Both can be found in large supermarkets or at Asian specialty markets.<br><br>Tip: To toast seeds: Cook in a small dry skillet over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until fragrant and lightly browned, 2 to 4 minutes.
