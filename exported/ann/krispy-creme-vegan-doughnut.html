            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1 1/2 tbsp dry yeast<br>1/4 cup water<br>1 1/2 cups warm non-dairy milk (I used So Delicious Unsweetened Coconut Milk)<br>1/2 cup sugar<br>1 tsp salt<br>1/2 cup applesauce<br>1/3 cup vegetable shortening<br>5 cups all purpose flour<br>vegetable oil (for frying)<br>

            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast in the 1/4 cup water.<br><br>Add the milk, sugar, salt, applesauce, shortening, and 2 cups of flour. Beat on low for 30 seconds - scraping the sides of the bowl as you go. Increase the speed to medium and beat for another 2 minutes.<br><br>Stir in the remaining 3 cups of flour and combine thoroughly. Cover the bowl with a towel and allow the dough to rise for 45 minutes to an hour. When the dough has increased in size and when poked - the indentation remains - it&#x27;s ready!<br><br>Dump the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and lightly coat with flour. Gently roll the dough to 1/2 inch thickness.<br><br>Cut the dough into strips and form them into the classic doughnut shape. Sometimes the strips will have to be cut in half so the doughnuts aren&#x27;t too big!<br><br>Once you&#x27;re done forming all the doughnuts - cover them and allow them to rise until they&#x27;ve doubled in size. It will usually take 30-40 minutes.<br><br>Heat the vegetable oil in a deep pot until it reaches 350 degrees F.<br><br>Carefully slide the doughnuts into the oil one at a time. Don&#x27;t over crowd them! Fry on each side until golden brown - about 1 minute on each side.<br><br>Place the doughnuts on a cooling rack lined with paper towels to allow them to drain and cool.<br>
