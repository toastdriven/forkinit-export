            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Heat oil in heavy skillet over medium heat. Add onions and saute for 5 minutes. Add winter squash cubes and continue to cook over medium heat, stirring often until squash is just tender. If your mixture begins to stick, add a little water (or apple juice) to help steam the squash. When squash is just tender, add cumin, cinnamon, and salt. Stir carefully to distribute spices. Add the beans and heat through.<br><br>Preheat oven to 350Â°F. You&#x27;re now ready to assemble the burritos. In a large oblong baking dish (not oiled) lay out one tortilla. Place 1/8 of the bean mixture down the center, top with 3 tablespoons of cheese and roll up tightly. Continue to do this with remaining ingredients, lining up your burritos in the pan as you go. Bake uncovered for approximately 15 to 20 minutes until burritos are heated through.<br><br>Serve burritos topped with a dollop of sour cream and a sprinkling of chopped fresh cilantro, with salsa on the side. Makes 8 burritos - enough for 8 polite adults, 6 hungry adults, or 4 teenage boys.
