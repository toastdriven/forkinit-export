            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                    2 cups cabbage, finely shredded<br>    1 cup leeks, well washed and chopped (see head notes)<br>    2/3 cup whole wheat pastry flour (or apf flour)<br>    a couple pinches of fine grain sea salt<br>    2 eggs, beaten<br>    1+ tablespoon olive oil<br><br>    Garnish: toasted slivered almonds, chives/ herbs<br>

            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Combine the cabbage, leeks, flour, and salt in a bowl. Toss until everything is coated with a dusting of flour. Stir in the eggs and mix until everything is evenly coated.<br><br>Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add a generous splash of olive oil. Scoop the cabbage mixture into the pan, and using a metal spatula press it into a round pancake shape, flat as you can get it. Cook for 4-5 minutes, or until the bottom is golden. To flip the okonomiyaki, slide it out of the skillet onto a plate. Place another plate on top and flip both (together) over. If you need a bit more oil in your skillet, add it now, before sliding the okonomiyaki back into the skillet. Again press down a bit with a spatula and cook until golden on this side - another 3 -5 minutes.<br><br>When you are finished cooking, sprinkle with toasted almonds and chives, and slide it onto a cutting board to cut into wedges. Enjoy immediately.<br><br>Serves 1 - 2.
