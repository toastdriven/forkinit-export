                Simply mix all the ingredients in a bowl and you are done. You can use the BBQ sauce right away but the flavors will mix together better if you the prepare it the night before and let the BBQ sauce stand in the refrigerator over night.<br><br>While this sauce tastes great just the way it is, you can look at this recipe as a base and add your own flavors to it. You may find that you end up with a unique homemade BBQ sauce which everyone is going to want the recipe for. You can experiment with it by adding a little bit more of the ingredients you like or by adding additional seasoning like garlic or ginger. You might also try replacing the mustard with dijon mustard or adding some hot sauce to spice things up a bit.
