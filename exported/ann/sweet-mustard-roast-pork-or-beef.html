            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                3 pounds beef or pork roast (mine was still frozen when I put it in)<br>1/3 cup molasses (this looks so much like melted ear wax to me) (that was kind of gross.) (sorry.)<br>1/3 cup dijon mustard<br>1 teaspoon garlic powder<br>2 tablespoons white vinegar (apple cider vinegar would work well, too)<br><br><br><br>
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-8">
            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Use a 4 quart slow cooker. If you have a larger model, that&#x27;s fine, but you won&#x27;t need to cook it as long---I&#x27;d check after 5 hours on low.<br><br>Dump meat into cooker. Top with molasses, dijon, and vinegar. Toss in the garlic powder. Using tongs, flip the meat over a few times to coat it nicely with the sauce. Cover and cook on low for 6-8 hours or on high for about 4.<br>The meat will be more tender if you cook it on low for a longish time.
