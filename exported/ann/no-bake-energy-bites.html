                Mix everything above in a medium bowl until thoroughly incorporated.  Let chill in the refrigerator for half an hour.  Once chilled, roll into balls and enjoy!  Store in an airtight container and keep refrigerated for up to 1 week.<br><br><br><br>Alright, let&#x27;s start with that gooey peanut butter, honey and some oatmeal and pour them into your mixing bowl.<br><br><br><br><br>Then add in a cup of coconut flakes, sweetened or unsweetened...your call.<br><br><br><br><br>Then you can add in your mix-ins.  I like to keep these somewhat healthy so I add mini-vegan chocolate chips and ground flaxseed.  But you could also add in some chopped nuts, dates, raisins and even switch out the flaxseed to wheat bran or something similar or even cocoa powder.  I love this recipe because it is pretty customizable to what you have in your pantry.<br><br><br><br><br>Then add in a teaspoon (or two) of vanilla!<br><br><br><br><br>Mix it all up and let it chill in your refrigerator for about a half hour.  <br><br><br><br><br>Then roll into balls and enjoy
