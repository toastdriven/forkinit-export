                Mix together lettuce, tomato, chicken, and grapes (or apples) in bowl and set aside. <br> <br>Mix oil, vinegar, and sugar in custard cup and stir until sugar is dissolved. <br> <br>Pour dressing in larger bowl and toss. <br> <br>To prepare the planes: Take each cucumber and cut a ¼ inch thick slice along one side. Keep the piece you have removed, as it will serve as the wings of the plane. <br> <br>Cut off one end of the cucumber and cut in half so you have 2 ½ circles. <br> <br>Using a spoon, scoop out the soft insides of the cucumber whose top has been removed. <br> <br>Add salad mixture to hollowed out cucumber <br> <br>Place the flat &quot;wing&quot; that was previously the top of the cucumber crosswise across the top so as to create two wings. <br> <br>Take one of the ½ circles and place it perpendicular to the plane at the tail.<br>
