            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                *Crushing the peppercorns can be done with a mortar and pestle. Or if you don&#x27;t have a mortar and pestle, place the whole peppercorns in a small ziplock bag and place that bag inside another ziplock bag and smash with a hammer. Do this on a hard surface, if done on a wood surface, it can leave dents. The ziplock will also tear a bit, so take care not to lose the crushed pepper (why you double bag it).<br>** Trader Joe&#x27;s has great frozen uncooked, shrimp, shelled and de-veined with tails on. To defrost frozen shrimp, place in a bowl of ice water in the refrigerator.<br><br><br>METHOD<br>1 Mix together the crushed garlic, salt, crushed peppercorns, lemon juice and brandy. Add the shrimp and marinate at least an hour or up to overnight in the fridge.<br>2 Heat a heavy skillet over medium high heat and add olive oil. Add shrimp and garlic mixture and cook quickly, tossing shrimp. The longer the shrimp has been marinating, the less time it takes to cook. Cook until the shrimp has turned opaque (generally only 2-3 minutes).<br>Garnish with chopped parsley.
