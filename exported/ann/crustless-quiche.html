                Cook bacon (I only had three pieces left, but next time I&#x27;ll use more) and keep a little of the bacon grease to saute your chopped onion.<br><br>Chop onion.<br><br><br><br>Scramble eggs in a large bowl. (My favorite vintage Pyrex bowl!)<br><br><br><br>Saute onion in a tablespoon or so of bacon grease until brown and carmelized. (I hate raw onion, but love it this way.) Pretend I took a picture of this, but instead I had a blond moment and forgot.<br><br>Combine broccoli, chopped tomato, sliced mushrooms, shredded cheese, onion, bacon, and steak seasoning with the eggs.<br><br><br><br>Preheat oven to 350 degrees.<br><br>Pour into a very lightly greased (with bacon grease of course!) deep dish pie plate.<br><br><br><br>Bake in oven for 37-40 minutes. Center should be set. Slice into 6 pieces and serve!<br><br><br><br>Enjoy! This broccoli quiche recipe (crustless quiche recipe) makes a fast breakfast reheated later in the week!
