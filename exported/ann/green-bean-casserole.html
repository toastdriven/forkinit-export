                This is meant to be a vegan version of the traditional green bean casserole served at holidays, etc., for those of you who loved it and were sad to not have it at the holidays once you went vegan. Many of my non-veggie friends like this better than traditional green bean casserole because it has more veggies and more herbs and spices.<br><br>Heat soy milk and veggie bouillon in a saucepan, stirring until bouillon cube disintegrates. Do not boil or scald the soy milk. Just heat it.<br><br>Sauté onions, carrots, and mushrooms in the veggie oil in a skillet. Add salt, pepper, and herbs and spices.<br><br>Mix the starch and water well, and pour into the soymilk/bouillon. Stir well, because this will coagulate pretty quickly. Quickly add the can of green beans, the sautéed veggies, and about half of your French fried onions, and stir well.<br><br>Pour that mixture into a casserole dish or pan and top with remaining French fried onions. Bake in oven at about 350 degrees for 10-15 minutes, until the onions begin to brown.  Remove. Eat. Enjoy.
