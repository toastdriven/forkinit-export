                1.  Take whatever oatmeal is leftover from breakfast and add cranberries, nut butter, maple syrup, apple sauce, spice and as much quick oats or other dried grains as it needs to become sticky but hold together texture and use your hands to combine everything. <br>2.  Then line a baking pan with parchment paper (I used a 9 by 13 pan but obviously it depends how much substance you have an how thick you want them to be.)<br>3. And bake at 350. Here&#x27;s the part that really has to specialize because the baking time depends on the thickness. They&#x27;ll always seem a bit soft until they cool off but I bake them until they&#x27;re quite dry on the top and don&#x27;t squish too much when pressed with your finger or a spoon. It can sometimes take up to an hour.<br>4.  Let them cool completely in the pan and lift out the parchment and you&#x27;re done. It takes some experimenting to get the texture the way you like. Some people prefer crunchy bars and others like chewy so it&#x27;s up to you.
