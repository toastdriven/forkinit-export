            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Preheat oven to 350 degrees.<br> <br>Fill a pot large enough to hold pepper halves with water and bring to a boil (don’t add peppers yet). <br> <br>In a smaller, separate pot, cook brown rice in vegetable broth according to package directions. <br> <br>Meanwhile, blanch red pepper halves in boiling water for 3 minutes. Remove with slotted spoon and place into a high-sided baking dish. <br> <br>Stir vegetables into prepared brown rice. Season with pepper and parsley. <br> <br>Spoon rice mixture into each pepper half. Brush tops lightly with olive oil, squeeze lemon to taste and sprinkle with grated cheese (approx. 2 tbsp. cheese per pepper). <br> <br>Place baking dish into oven and cook until the peppers are soft and the cheese is melted and golden, about 35 minutes. <br> <br>Transfer the peppers onto a large plate and put the cabbage on top in a criss-crossed pattern to look like the laces on a ballet shoe.<br>
