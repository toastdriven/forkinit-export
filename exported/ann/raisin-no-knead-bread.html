            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                In a large bowl, combine flour, yeast, salt, raisisn and half the brown sugar. Add water and mix with a wooden spoon until thoroughly combined (dough will be very stiff and shaggy). Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let sit in a warm place for 12-18 or more hours.<br><br>Turn dough onto a well-floured surface. Generously dust dough with cinnamon. Fold it over a few times; dust another surface with cinnamon and fold more. Cover dough with a floured cotton cloth and let sit in a warm place for 2 hours or until it almost doubles in size. With well-floured hands, turn dough over a few times to ensure that it doesn’t stick to its surface. Let rest for another 10 minutes before baking.<br><br>Heat a heavy cast-iron Dutch oven in an oven at 450 degrees for half an hour. Carefully open lid and drop dough into it. Sprinkle dough’s top with remaining brown sugar and sugar mixture. Replace lid and bake for 15-20 minutes. Remove Dutch oven lid and let bake for another 10-15 minutes or until its crust is browned. Remove from oven and let rest on a cooling rack for at least half an hour before serving
