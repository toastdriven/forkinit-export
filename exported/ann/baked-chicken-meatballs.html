                3 slices Italian bread, torn into small bits (1 cup)<br>1/3 cup milk<br>3 ounces sliced pancetta, finely chopped (you can swap in Canadian Bacon if you can’t find pancetta)<br>1 small onion, finely chopped<br>1 small garlic clove, minced<br>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided<br>1 large egg<br>1 pound ground chicken<br>2 tablespoons tomato paste, divided*<br>3 tablespoons finely chopped flat-leaf parsley

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Preheat oven to 400°F with a racks the upper thirds. Soak bread in milk in a small bowl until softened, about four minutes.<br><br>Cook pancetta, onion, and garlic in one tablespoon oil with 1/2 teaspoon each of salt and pepper in a large skillet over medium heat until onion is softened, about 6 minutes. (Alternately, as in “I thought of this after the fact”, I’d bet you could render the pancetta for a couple minutes and cook the onions and garlic in that fat, rather than olive oil.) Cool slightly.<br><br>Squeeze bread to remove excess milk, then discard milk. Lightly beat egg in a large bowl, then combine with chicken, 1 tablespoon tomato paste, pancetta mixture, bread, and parsley. Form 12 meatballs and arrange in another 4-sided sheet pan (I used a 9×13 roasting dish).<br><br>Stir together remaining tablespoons of tomato paste and oil and brush over meatballs (the paste/oil does not mix in any cohesive manner, but just smoosh it on and run with it) , then bake in upper third of oven until meatballs are just cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes (though mine took a good 5 minutes longer).<br><br>* I accidentally added a heaping tablespoon of the tomato paste into the meatball mixture the first time I made it, and ended up liking it better than without it. I’d use the tomato paste on top too. It’s good both places.<br>
