            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Preheat oven to 350<br>Spray a 11 x 7 inch glass baking dish with non-stick cooking spray<br>For the Sauce<br>Char the peppers. I do mine on the gas grill so my kitchen doesn&#x27;t smell like charred peppers. Many people use the open flame of a gas stove burner. Peppers can also be charred in the oven. You&#x27;re looking for the pepper skin to be black and have a blistered appearance. Once charred, place the peppers in a bowl covered with plastic wrap and let sit for a few minutes. Remove and wipe skin off using a paper towel. Remove the stem, seeds and membranes then dice the peppers. I know this sounds complicated but, its really simple and you&#x27;ll love the flavor.<br>Melt the 2 tablespoons of butter in a large skillet with 2 inch sides. Add the onions and cook until translucent.<br>Next, add the peppers and cook an additional 1-2 minutes.<br>Add the skim milk and cream cheese and stir to melt the cream cheese.<br>Simmer mixture over medium heat until it thickens (about 4-6) minutes.<br>Mixture can now either be cooled and processed in a blender OR you can use an immersion blender directly in the skillet you used to heat the mixture. Either way you&#x27;re looking for creamy sauce consistency.<br>Salt and Pepper to taste.<br>For the Enchilada&#x27;s<br>Fill each tortilla with a little of the remaining onion, monterey jack cheese and chicken. Reserve some cheese to top enchilada&#x27;s<br>Tightly roll filled tortillas and transfer to prepared pan. Be sure to put the seam side down. Note: Should be a pretty snug fit<br>Pour prepared sauce over the enchilada&#x27;s and top with remaining cheese.<br>Cover with foil and bake for 25-30minutes
