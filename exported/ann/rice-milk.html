            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Directions<br>Thoroughly wash the rice.<br>Put 8 cups of water in a big pot and bring it to a boil over high heat.<br>Pour in the rice.<br>Cover the pot and lower the heat to let the water simmer.<br>Cook for 3 hours.<br><br>You will end up with something that looks a bit like a soupy rice pudding. Add the salt.<br><br>In batches, fill your blender halfway with the rice mixture and halfway with water. Blend until very smooth. Strain twice through a fine mesh strainer into a mason jar. Continue on with the rest of the milk until you’re finished, filling jars and screwing the lids on good and tight.<br><br>Even with the extra water, the homemade rice milk ends up thicker than the product you might be used to if you’ve always purchased Rice Dream Rice Milk. It’s more like rice cream! You may want to dilute it further at the time of serving it. Just add a bit more water until it’s the desired consistency.<br><br>Optional Additions To Your Rice Milk Recipe<br><br>A look at the label of Rice Dream Rice Milk reveals that it contains oil. Oil does make things creamier, and we like to add about 2 Tablespoons of organic sunflower oil to our batch of milk.<br><br>We also like to add about 4 Tablespoons of Maple Syrup to our batch of milk, as we are still used to the slightly sweeter taste of the Rice Dream product than what you get from homemade. It’s not a big difference…just a little one.<br><br>Making a blended rice and nut milk is a cinch. At the blending stage, add some blanched raw almonds or hazelnuts, or some cashews for an even richer, creamier, more nutritious milk.<br>
