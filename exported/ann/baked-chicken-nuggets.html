                2 lb. chicken breasts<br>2/3 cups breadcrumbs<br>1 cup  whole-wheat flour<br>2 eggs<br>¼ peanut oil (adjust to vegetable oil for allergies)<br>2-3 tsp. salt<br>½ tsp. ground black pepper<br>¼ cup milk

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Start by measuring all ingredients and setting out in small containers to make it easier for Sproutlets to add the ingredients.<br>Grown ups can cut up chicken breasts into bite sized pieces. Rinse thoroughly, and dry with paper towels.<br>While chicken dries, mix together breadcrumbs and flour in one mixing bowl and milk, eggs and oil in another mixing bowl.<br>Season the dry chicken as desired. Dip chicken in milk/oil/egg mixture then roll in flour mixture. Place pieces on parchment covered baking sheet.<br>Spritz the chicken generously with peanut oil or vegetable oil to moisten. Unless you have allergy concerns, peanut oil is recommended rather than substituting for vegetable oil.<br>Cover loosely with foil and bake for 30 minutes at 350 degrees. Use tongs to turn halfway through baking.<br>Serve your baked chicken nuggets in pails lined with wax paper! You can even put shredded green tissue paper under the wax paper  to look like grass. Tip:  The secret is seasoning the chicken while it’s dry, and using peanut oil! These are great frozen and reheated in the oven to retain crunch!<br>
