            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                filling:<br>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Blanch the carrots in boiling salted water for 3 minutes. Add the zucchini  and cook 1 more minute. Drain and run under cold water. Set aside.<br><br>Melt the margarine in a large saucepan over medium heat and add the onions. Cook until translucent. Add the flour; cook, stirring constantly for about 2 minutes, and do not let the flour brown.<br><br>Add the broth and cook, stirring constantly, until thickened. Stir in the soy milk and Cognac. Cook over low heat until thick (about 3 minutes).<br><br>Stir in the tarragon, salt, and pepper, and simmer for a minute. Add the chicken and vegetables, mix gently into the cream sauce, and remove from heat. Pour the chicken/vegetable filling into a deep 2-quart casserole dish.<br><br>crust:<br>In a large bowl, mix together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. In a smaller bowl, mix together the oil and yogurt. Fold the oil mixture into the dry ingredients with a fork. Using your hands, working the dough as little as possible, form it into a ball. Turn the dough onto a clean surface. Cut the dough in half, place on half on top of the other, and press down. Repeat 2 to 3 times.<br><br>With pressure from your hands, flatten the dough into a circle to fit your casserole dish and place it over the filling. Place the dish on a baking sheet and bake on the middle rack until the crust is golden, about 30 minutes. Serve immediately. Makes 6 portions.
