                Instructions: <br><br>1. Prepare whole wheat calzone dough by putting ingredients (in order listed) into a large bowl (or bread machine), using about 2 cups of the flour. Stir to combine; continue adding flour and knead mixture with hands to make a smooth, elastic dough. Knead 5 minutes. Let dough rest while you prepare the filling.<br><br>(steps 2-4 prep your filling- I used leftover veggies and smoked mozzarella, then topped the completed calzone with picante sauce)<br><br>4. Divide dough into 6 equal pieces. Pat or roll each piece into a 7-inch circle on a lightly floured surface.<br><br>5. Top half of each circle with about 3/4 cup of the filling mixture, spreading to within one inch of the edge. Fold dough over filling and crimp edges to seal, leaving a half-circle.<br><br>6. Place calzones on greased cookie sheets or jelly roll pans. Sprinkle with salt if desired. Bake at 375 degrees until bread is cooked and filling is hot, about 25-30 minutes. Cover loosely with foil part way through baking if calzones start to brown too quickly.

                <strong>Yields:</strong> I made 4 very large calzones.  I should have made them smaller, but they still turned out awesome!  I plan to use this recipe to make mini-calzones soon since my toddler loved them.
