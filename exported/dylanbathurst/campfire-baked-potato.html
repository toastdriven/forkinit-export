            Campfire baked potatoes are a great and easy dinner while out camping. They can be as simple or loaded down with toppings as you want.

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Make sure the fire is hot enough and has been burning long enough to have a good amount of coals at the bottom. Make a space that can accommodate the potatoes but also be mostly covered by other logs. Double wrap each potato in tin foil. One or both layers of tin foil will most likely rip in the fire. Let the potato sit in the coals for 45 minutes to an hour flipping it over once halfway through. <br><br>Periodically throughout the duration cooking the potato poke it with a knife or fork. When the potato becomes soft in the middle it&#x27;s ready to eat!<br><br>Take the potato out of the coals and let it sit for a couple minutes before eating. Cut off part of the potato and start applying your toppings.
