                2 cups chopped cauliflower (stems is okay)<br>1 cup water<br>1 cup unsweetened plant milk (I used oat)<br>2 Tbsp nutritional yeast<br>1/8 tsp turmeric<br>pinch of sweet paprika<br>1 tsp salt<br>1/8 cup cashews<br>2 tsp lemon juice<br>1 tsp msg (or soy sauce or tamari sauce)<br>16 oz whole grain macaroni pasta<br>4 cups water

            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Put the chopped cauliflower and 1 cup of water in the Instant Pot and cook with high pressure for 7 minutes. Do a quick release when done.<br>Meanwhile, add 1 cup oat milk, 2 tablespoons nutritional yeast, 1/8 teaspoon turmeric, a pinch of paprika, 1 teaspoon of salt, 1/8 cup of cashews, 2 teaspoons of lemon juice and 1 teaspoon of MSG to a blender. Add in the cooked cauliflower (and any remaining liquid in the pot) and blend at high speed until totally smooth.. It will make about 3 1/2 cups of sauce.<br>After you have cooked the cauliflower and removed it from the Instant Pot, add in 16 oz of macaroni pasta and 4 cups of water to the Instant Pot. Put the lid on, set the valve to sealing, and pressure cook (or press Manual) for 2 minutes. Do a quick release when done.<br>Pour the sauce over the cooked macaroni in the Instant Pot and stir to combine well. You can add salt and pepper to taste, if desired.
