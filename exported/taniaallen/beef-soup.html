                1-2 lbs stew beef<br>1-2 lbs carrots, peeled and sliced<br>2 small cans tomato paste<br>1 bunch celery, washed and sliced<br>6-8 oz ancini di pepe pasta (orzo and ditalini also work .. anything very small)

            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. Put stew beef in bottom of a large stew/stock pot. Fill pot with water to a few inches over beef.<br>2. Cook on med-high heat until beef is cooked ~ about an hour. (Watch out for boil-over. Skim off rendered fat from top periodically.)<br>3. When beef is cooked through, add tomato paste and allow to dissolve fully.<br>4. Add carrots and celery. Cook until carrots are tender.<br>5. Add pasta and cook or 6-8 minutes, depending on pasta used. (If necessary, add more water. I usually heat the water first to keep from having to re-boil.)<br>6. Add salt/pepper to taste, and enjoy! (Hubby also adds Parmesan cheese when I make it for him, though I prefer it without.)
