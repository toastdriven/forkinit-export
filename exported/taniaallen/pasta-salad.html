            A very easy pasta salad you can make in batches to eat from for a few days - if it lasts that long.

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1 box rotini or bow-tie pasta<br>4 ounces cooked ham, cubed, or 4 ounces cooked chicken, cubed (I like to use leftover rotisserie chicken)<br>1 or 2 cucumbers, peeled and sliced<br>1 container grape or cherry tomatoes, halved<br>1 can baby corn, drained and cubed<br>Your dressing of choice; I usually use a three-cheese ranch or cucumber ranch, or italian, but it&#x27;s really whatever you like.<br><br>You can add whatever vegetables you like to this salad. I sometimes chop up an egg or two for extra protein. It really is easily adjusted to anyone&#x27;s liking.

            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. Cook pasta according to directions. Drain, rinse in cool water, drain again.<br>2. Add vegetables and meats to cooled/drained pasta. Toss gently to combine.<br>3. Add dressing and toss again lightly to just coat everything. Add more or less dressing according to your taste. <br><br>I keep this in a big Rubbermaid covered bowl in the refrigerator when I make it, and it will last a few days at least .. if it doesn&#x27;t get eaten in the first day.
