            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.<br>Roll out half of the pie dough and press into a 9-inch tart pan with a removeable bottom.   Line the unbaked shell with foil and fill with dried beans or pie weights.  Bake for 20-25 minutes.<br>Remove the pie weights and continue baking the shell for another 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown.  Remove from the oven and let cool completely.<br>For the pastry cream, combine the milk, cream and vanilla bean in a small saucepan and bring to a boil.  Remove from the heat and let steep for 15 minutes.  Remove the bean from the liquid and scrape the seeds from the bean into the milk/cream mixture.  Discard the pod.<br>Combine the sugar and yolks in a medium bowl and whisk until thoroughly combined.<br>Fill a large bowl with ice water.<br>Combine the cornstarch with the 3 ounces of milk and stir to dissolve.<br>Over medium heat, bring the milk/cream mixture just to a simmer.  Drizzle a little of the warmed mixture into the egg yolks while whisking continuously to temper the eggs.  Slowly add the rest of the milk/cream mixture.  Pour the mixture back into the saucepan and add the cornstarch/milk mixture.  Continue stirring over medium heat until it just starts to boil and becomes very thick.  Immediately remove from the heat and dunk the base of the saucepan into the ice water.  Continue to stir until it cools slightly and add the butter.  Stir until melted.<br>Transfer the mixture to a bowl and cover with plastic wrap, pressing the plastic against the surface.  Refrigerate until completely cool.<br>When ready to assemble your pie, spread the cooled pastry cream evenly over your baked crust.  Top the pastry cream with berries of your choice.  I choose fresh strawberries, which I quartered, and fresh blueberries, but you can top with any fruit that is in season.  Enjoy!
