            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Sprinkle duck pieces all over with salt, a generous amount, the way you would a roast chicken or thick steak before you cook it.<br>Roughly chop cloves and peppercorns with a knife and distribute evenly over the duck pieces.<br>Slice garlic and press slices onto each piece of duck.<br>Break bay leaves in half and press one half leaf onto each piece of duck.<br>Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight or up to 48 hours.  <br>Rinse ducks under cold water, wiping off all garlic and seasonings.  Pat dry.<br>Place legs in a pot and cover with olive oil.  Bring to a simmer over medium high heat, then place uncovered in a low oven (180 degrees F./80 degrees C. is optimal for 6 to 10 hours or until the legs are completely tender, the fat has become clear, and the legs rest on the bottom of the pan.<br>Remove from oven and cool to room temperature then refrigerate until thoroughly chilled.  Be sure the duck is completely submerged.  Store covered in the refrigerator for up to a month.<br>The day you plan to serve the confit, remove it from the fridge several hours before reheating to allow fat to soften.  Preheat oven to 425 degrees F./220 degrees C.  Remove the legs from the fat.  Place them in a pan or on a baking sheet and roast until the meat is warmed through and the skin is crispy, 15 to 20 minutes.  If you want a really fast and quick way to ensure crispy skin, simply deep fry them for a minute or two.
