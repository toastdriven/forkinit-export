                1 cauliflower<br>1 tbsp canola oil<br>3 oz (80 g) butter, at room temperature or softened<br>kosher salt

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Preheat your oven to 425˚F/220˚C.<br>Cut the stem off the cauliflower as close to the base as possible and remove any leaves. Rub oil all over the cauliflower.<br>Put the cauliflower in an oven-proof skillet. Slide the pan into the oven and roast the cauliflower for 45 minutes. Remove it from the oven and smear the soft butter over the surface. Sprinkle with a four-finger pinch of salt.  Roast the cauliflower for another 30 to 45 minutes, basting it several times with the butter, which will have browned. It’s done when you can insert a paring knife into it and feel no resistence. It should be completely tender.
