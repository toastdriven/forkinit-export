                Heat the olive oil and 1 tbsp of the butter in a large saucepan over medium-high heat for 1 minute.<br>Add the onions, corn, salt, white pepper, and black pepper and saute for 3 minutes.<br>Add the garlic and cook, stirring, an additional 30 seconds.<br>Using a wooden spoon, stir in the arborio and cook, stirring constantly for 2 minutes so that each grain of rice is evenly coated with the oil.<br>Stir in the mushrooms and 1 C of the stock, stirring constantly until the liquid is absorbed.<br>Continue adding stock, 1/2 C at a time and stirring until absorbed, until all of the stock has been used. The last addition of the stock into the risotto should leave it slightly tight.<br>Stir in the remaining butter, the cream, grated cheese and truffle oil; the risotto should have a creamy appearance and texture.<br>Remove from heat and serve immediately. Garnish with shaved truffles, if desired.
