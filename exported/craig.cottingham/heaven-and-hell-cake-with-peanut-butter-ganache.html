            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                <br>For angel food cake:<br>Preheat oven to 375°F.<br>Cut a circle of parchment paper or wax paper to fit the bottom of a 9&quot; cake pan. Do not grease the pan or paper.<br>Sift together flour and powdered sugar and set aside.<br>Place egg whites in the bowl of a heavy duty mixer. Beat slowly while adding salt and cream of tartar and continue beating for 1 minute or until soft peaks form. Increase speed to medium, add sugar by tablespoonfuls until all is incorporated, then beat about 1 1/2 minutes longer.<br>When egg whites have stiff peaks, add vanilla and almond extract.<br>Remove bowl from mixer and sprinkle half of the powdered sugar/flour mixture and fold in, then repeat with the remaining mixture. Use the minimum number of strokes so the egg whites do not deflate.<br>Gently spoon the mixture into the pan and bake for 40 to 50 minutes or until golden brown. Do not overbake or the cake will sink in the center.<br><br>For devils food cake:<br>Preheat oven to 350°F.<br>Oil and flour a 9&quot; cake pan.<br>Sift the cocoa powder into the mixing bowl, then drizzle in the coffee while whisking to make a smooth paste. Set aside.<br>Combine shortening, sugar, vanilla, and eggs and beat for 2 minutes on medium speed. The result might be more liquid than paste.<br>In a separate bowl, sift together the flour, salt, baking powder and baking soda.<br>Alternately add the cocoa-coffee mixture and the flour mixture to the sugar-egg mixture and continue beating until incorporated.<br>Pour batter into prepared pan and bake for 30 minutes or until done.<br><br>When both cakes have cooled, carefully slice them in half horizontally with a long serrated knife so that you now have four layers.<br>Place one layer of the devils food cake on a cake plate and spoon 1/3 of the peanut butter ganache on the top.<br>Place one layer of the angel food cake on top and spread with another 1/3 of the peanut butter ganache.<br>Continue layering until you have four layers of cake and three layers of mousse.<br>Whisk the chocolate ganache and spread with a spatula over the top and sides to frost generously.<br>Chill in the refrigerator for at least two hours before serving.<br>Serve chilled; slice with a warm, wet knife.<br>
