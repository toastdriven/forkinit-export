                100 g butter<br>5 dl milk<br>2 tbsp sugar<br>1 tsp ground cardamom<br>1 tsp salt<br>1 pkg (50g) yeast for sweet dough<br>14 dl bread flour<br>100 g butter<br>1 C sugar<br>2 tbsp ground cardamom<br>2 tsp vanilla sugar<br>1 egg + nib sugar

            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Melt 100 g butter in a saucepan.<br>Pour in the milk, 2 tbsp sugar, 1 tsp cardamom and salt.<br>Bring it to 37°C (body temperature rather than hot to touch).<br>Crumble the yeast into a large mixing bowl and pour in the liquid; stir to dissolve yeast.<br>Pour in most of the flour and work into the flour, ideally with an electric beater and dough hooks, 5 minutes by machine, at least 10 minutes by hand. The more you knead, the better the buns, the dough will become tough and only slightly sticky.<br>Let rise in plastic wrap for one hour or more will not hurt.<br>Take out the remaining butter, cardamom and sugar.<br>Squeeze the dough and put it out on a floured surface, working by hand and with floured rolling pin to form a rectangle that is about 20-40 cm high (depending on how big buns of your choice), quite thin and so wide it becomes , no point in two installments as long as you have room to roll. Make sure it does not stick during the roll up dough on rolling pin and flour in if needed.<br>Grease the dough in addition to 2 cm at the top, like with the underside of the spoon.<br>Sprinkle the sugar in the desired amount, and sprinkle cardamom in the dough in addition to 10 cm on the low side.<br>In the lower strip we sprinkle the vanilla sugar.<br>To then roll dough loosely from the bottom up into a long sausage, pinch the seam tightly.<br>Slice into about 25mm thick slices and transfer to plates with parchment paper, place them with an inch apart, they ferment quite a lot. To me, the two plates with 12 balls each, will roll uneven attempts to have them smaller buns on one plate and the bigger on the other for more even baking!<br>Turn the oven to 250°C and let the buns rise under a tea towel / plastic about 30 minutes.<br>Mix one egg and brush thinly on the buns and sprinkle with a little granulated sugar before baking.<br>Bake in middle of oven about 6 minutes to them a good color!<br>Let cool on a rack over a kitchen towel, enjoy a couple of buns while they are piping hot, freeze what you do not have the same days as soon as it is cold!
