            A rotisserie chicken stands in quite well for the original tandoori chicken in this version of the simple north Indian dish. In just a few simple steps with a handful of spices, an ordinary chicken become an exotic, family-pleasing meal with a richly spiced sauce that melds right into the chicken. The dish is done when the meat is — as Indian cookbook author Julie Sahni describes it — “meltingly tender.” Serve with spinach, quickly cooked in oil and garlic to complete the meal.
