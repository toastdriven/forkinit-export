            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                <br>Beurre Blanc:<br>Combine the shallots, lemon juice, wine, thyme, peppercorns, bay leaves, and roasted garlic in a small sauce pot.<br>Bring to a boil and reduce until almost dry, leaving about 1/8 C.<br>Reduce heat to low and add the cream.<br>Begin adding the butter, 1 cube at a time, whisking continuously. As each cube incorporates into the sauce, add another until all butter has been added.<br>Strain through a fine mesh strainer.<br>Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper. If you feel that the sauce is too acidic, add a bit of honey to balance the flavor. Be sure to use only a small amount of honey so as not to make the sauce taste too sweet.<br>Cover and keep warm until ready to serve.<br><br>Mushrooms:<br>Place a saute pan over high heat and add enough canola oil to just cover the bottom of the pan. Allow the pan to preheat until you just begin to see light wisps of smoke coming from the pan.<br>Add the mushrooms and begin to saute until the mushrooms are cooked halfway.<br>Add the garlic and shallots to the pan and continue to saute, keeping the mushrooms moving at all times.<br>When the mushrooms are just cooked through add the fresh herbs to the pan and season with salt and pepper, to taste.<br>Taste the mushrooms and adjust the seasoning, if necessary.<br>Cover and keep warm while you saute the scallops.<br><br>Scallops:<br>In a bowl, toss the sea scallops lightly in 1/2 cup canola oil. Season each scallop evenly on both sides with salt and pepper.<br>Put a saute pan that is large enough to hold the scallops in 1 layer without them touching over high heat.<br>Add enough canola oil to just cover the bottom of the pan. Allow the pan to preheat until you begin to see light wisps of smoke coming from the oil.<br>Add the scallops to the pan carefully and allow them to get a deep golden brown color.<br>Turn the scallops and allow the second side to get the same golden brown color. If you want the scallops to be more cooked, place the scallops in a preheated 350 degree F oven until they reach the desired doneness.<br>Serve with mushrooms and drizzle with buerre blanc sauce.
