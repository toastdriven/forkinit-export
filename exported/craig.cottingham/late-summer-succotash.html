            To prepare the soy beans, simply boil them in their pods until their tender, then chill them in ice water or in plenty of continuously running cold water. They pop right out of the pod. You can simply sprinkle a bowl of cooked pods with coarse salt and serve as is. You could oil and salt them and heat them over coals for a grilled soy bean treat.
