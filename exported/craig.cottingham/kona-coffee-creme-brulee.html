            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                For coffee syrup:<br>Simmer coffee until reduced to 1/4 C, about 7 to 10 minutes.<br><br>Preheat oven to 350°F.<br>In a large saucepan, heat the cream and vanilla bean over medium-high heat until the cream almost comes to a boil.<br>While the cream is heating, in a large bowl whisk together the sugar and egg yolks until blended.<br>Slowly whisk the hot cream into the eggs to temper, until all of the cream is incorporated. Discard the vanilla bean.<br>Stir the coffee syrup into the custard, then strain, removing any lumps.<br>Divide the custard among 6 5-oz ramekins and place the ramekins into a large baking dish. Fill the dish with boiling water to come halfway up the sides of the ramekins.<br>Gently place the baking dish in the oven. Loosely cover the top with a sheet of foil and bake until the custards are set (they will form a skin and jiggle slightly when tapped), about 25 minutes. Remove from heat and cool slightly.<br>When the ramekins are cool enough to handle, place the custards in the refrigerator to chill completely. The custards will keep for two to three days, refrigerated.<br>Place a little sugar on top of each custard and brûlee with a torch before serving.
