                This burnished-orange soup has a silken texture and a beautiful sheen, thanks to the addition of oatmeal-a terrific short-cut technique for creating quick body and creaminess. Chopping the squash and celery very finely in the food processor dramatically reduces cooking time without forsaking full-bodied taste. Be sure to include the chive (or scallion) garnish, which adds dramatic visual and flavor contrast. If you like, stir in a tablespoon of basil or rosemary olive oil at the end for an additional flavor dimension.<br><br>Using the food processor, finely chop the squash in several batches. (You should have about 5 cups.) Transfer to a large bowl. Finely chop the celery. Set aside with the squash.<br><br>In a large soup pot, heat the 2 tbsp. of water and sauté the leeks for 1 minute. Add the water and stock powder and bring to a boil over high heat. Stir in the squash, celery, oats, Herbes de Provence, and salt and return to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium, cover, and cook at a gentle boil until the squash is very soft, about 15 minutes.<br><br>Puree the soup with an immersion blender (or cool slightly, then transfer in small batches to a food processor or blender and blend until smooth).<br><br>Stir in enough vinegar to heighten the flavors. Add a bit more salt if needed, and reheat if necessary. Garnish with the chives.<br><br>Cooking under pressure: After the initial sauté, cook all the ingredients in a pressure cooker for 4 minutes under high pressure. Use a quick-release method or allow the pressure to come down naturally. Proceed as directed in the recipe.
