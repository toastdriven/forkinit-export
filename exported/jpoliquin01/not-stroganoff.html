            This started as a low-fat stroganoff recipe. By the time I and my family were done with it only a few ingredients remained from the original recipe and it has turned into a comfort food meal for my family. To make it healthier you could easily add veggies.

                Cook egg noodles according to package directions and then drain<br><br>While water is begining to boil and noodles are cooking, add oil and diced onion to a warm skillet and cook for a few minutes so the onion begins to soften.  Then add ground beef and garlic and cook over medium high heat until the beef is cooked through and the onion is soft. Drain grease from meat and add paprika. Mix well. Keep on low heat while you mix the sauce.<br><br>In a separate bowl whisk together all sauce ingredients until well combined. Pour sauce over ground beef mixture and cook over medium heat until warmed through, bubbling and slightly thickened.  Mix in egg noodles and parsley and serve.<br><br>*You could easily substitute beef broth or stock and a bit of salt, and I often do. However this is what I had on hand the day I actually wrote the recipe down.
