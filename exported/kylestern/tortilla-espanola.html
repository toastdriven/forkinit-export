            A classic Spanish dish consisting of potatoes, eggs and onion. The possibilities of variation are seemingly endless. You can keep it really simple or dress it up with your choice of one or more of the following: garlic, cheese (parmesan works well), ham or prosciutto, chorizo, bell peppers, spinach, etc.

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. Wash and peel potatoes (or opt to leave skin on, your choice) then slice to 1/8&quot; thickness. This is easily done with a mandolin slicer but if you do not have this tool I recommend slicing the potato lengthwise then, with the cut-side down, slice the potatoes as thinly and evenly as possible.<br>2. Rinse the potatoes to remove the starch; pat dry.<br>3. While potatoes are drying, heat 2-3 tblsps. olive oil in heavy-bottom pan. Chop garlic and onions while pan is heating.<br>4. Add potatoes, onions, and garlic to pan. Cook until potatoes are soft enough to easily &quot;mash&quot; with a wooden spoon; about 10-15 minutes. Season with salt and fresh-ground black pepper<br>5. While potatoes are cooking, beat eggs well.<br>6. When potatoes have finished cooking, transfer to a large bowl to cool slightly. This will prevent the eggs from cooking when you add them to the potatoes. After the potatoes have cooled slightly, add eggs to potatoes. Stir potato and egg mixture to ensure complete coverage.<br>8. Heat 1/2 tblsp. oil in 10&quot; non-stick skillet; add potato and egg mixture to skillet, &quot;shake&quot; skillet to evenly distribute the mixture. Cook for about 10 minutes, or until the eggs begin to set and the sides of the tortilla begin to pull away from the side of the pan.<br>9. Once eggs begin to set slightly, place a large plate over the top of the pan then, holding the plate tightly over the top of the skillet, use both wrists to &quot;flip&quot; the tortilla onto the plate. Place skillet back on the burner and add remaining 1/2 tblsp. olive oil. Slide tortilla from plate back into skillet, using a spatula to catch any loose potato and egg.<br>10. Cook second side for about 5 minutes, or until the tortilla easily slides around in the pan. The goal is for both sides to be golden brown and for the eggs to be fully set. Transfer tortilla to fresh plate to cool.<br><br>Serve at room temperature or cold. Cut into wedges and serve alongside baguette, Spanish cheese (Manchego would be a good choice), Salad, or fresh fruit (or all of the above). Another application of the dish is to take chilled wedges and use it between slices of baguette for a sandwich called &quot;Bocadillo de Tortilla.&quot;
