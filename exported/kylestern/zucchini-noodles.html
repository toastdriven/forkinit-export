                Peel zucchini into strips resembling wide noodles. Place &#x27;noodles&#x27; in colander and top with salt. Let zucchini drain for 30 minutes. Rinse noodles with water so the dish doesn&#x27;t turn out too salty then pat dry with towel before cooking.<br>Heat oil in pan, saut√© onion until slightly tender. Add garlic and cook mixture for about 2 minutes. Add zucchini noodles and heat through. Season with salt and pepper to taste.<br><br>Variations:<br>This dish is really meant to be built up to suit your needs. The zucchini noodles are a great stand-in for pasta if you&#x27;re looking for a gluten-free solution or just want to integrate more fresh vegetables in a larger meal.
