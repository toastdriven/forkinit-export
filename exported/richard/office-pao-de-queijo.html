            That cheesy bread from you local Brazilian fogo place is epic right? But at some point you have to leave and go to work. How are you to survive the hours away from this luscious delicacy? You have a toaster oven in the breakroom, right? I&#x27;ve got you covered.

                Preheat toaster oven to &quot;Bake&quot;, whatever the heck that is. (probably 350째-400째)<br>Grease a mini muffin pan.<br>Put all of the ingredients into a blender and pulse until smooth. You may need to use a spatula to scrape down the sides of the blender so that everything gets blended well.<br>At this point you can store the batter in the refrigerator for up to a week.<br>Bake in the oven for 19 minutes, until all puffy and just lightly browned.<br>Remove from oven and and pan quickly. Do not let cool. It is worth the blisters to eat it now.<br>Eat while warm or save to reheat later.<br>Enough batter for 16 mini muffin sized cheese breads.<br>Note that Brazilian cheese bread is very chewy, a lot like Japanese mochi.<br>
