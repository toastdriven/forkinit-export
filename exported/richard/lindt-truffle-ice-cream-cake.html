            The Betty Crocker Bake &#x27;n Fill cake pan allows you to make hollow/filled hemisphere cakes. The obvious thing to do with this is to make a sports themed cake. In a household of girls, the obvious thing for me to make out of that shape is a Lindt Chocolate Truffle.

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                The Pan:<br>You can ignore the instruction that came with the pan. It calls for 2 packages of cake and then tells you to make 12 cupcakes with the leftover. I think they just want to sell more cake mix!<br><br>Make room in your freezer for a frozen cake. Seriously. If you can&#x27;t do this, don&#x27;t make the cake.<br><br>Begin preheating the oven to 350ยบ.<br><br>Line the bowl of the &quot;insert pan&quot; with parchment paper or plastic wrap.<br><br>Pack the lined bowl with ice cream or frozen yogurt, pressing hard to fill in air gaps.<br><br>Place into freezer to firm.<br><br>Make the cake batter as indicated on the package.<br><br>Grease hemisphere pan and the flat base pan with vegetable shortening. Do not use oil or cooking spray.<br><br>Fill the hemisphere pan just enough to cover the indicator line when the batter settles. As the batter settles the inverse meniscus around the edges will fill in, so if you pour batter until you cover the line, you&#x27;ve over done it and must spoon some out.<br><br>Fill the base pan half full and bake 19 minutes until an inserted tooth pic comes out clean. Do not bake both pans at once. It affects the evenness.<br><br>Remove from the insert pan the half-ball of ice cream and leave it in the freezer.<br><br>Warm the insert pan in the hot oven for about 15 seconds, removing it with an oven mitt just in case. If it is hot to the touch, wave it in the air to cool it before continuing.<br><br>Attach the insert pan into the hemisphere pan and bake 37 minutes until an inserted tooth pic (or long split bamboo skewer) comes out clean. Use the holes in the insert pan to insert the tooth pic.<br><br>Let the cake cool 20 minutes before you try to separate the pans.<br><br>Place the base layer on your serving dish.<br><br>Place the formed ice cream on base layer.<br><br>Place the cake dome on top. (This is MUCH EASIER than trying to get the ice cream dropped perfectly level into the bowl of the cake dome.)<br><br>There will be a gap between the two layers of cake. Fill it with frosting or spooned ice cream if you feel adventurous. (The latter is quite difficult, but the final frosting will hide a lot of mistakes.<br><br>Frost the cake quickly and place in the freezer. (You&#x27;ve already made room for the cake, right?)<br><br>For a smoother finish you can polish the semi-frozen surface with parchment paper and the back of a metal serving spoon.
