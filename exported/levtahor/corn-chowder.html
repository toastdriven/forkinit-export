            I was wondering what kind of soup I could make if all I had for veggies was corn and potatoes and some other odds and ends from my garden.  Loosely followed a recipe online... so loosely, I have to write up a new one.  Sorry... I am guessing at amounts for this... put what LOOKS right. :)

                1 quart chicken broth<br>4 cups corn<br>1 small onion, diced<br>2 leeks, sliced thinly<br>2 T chives, chopped<br>5 medium potatoes, diced small<br>8 oz of cream cheese<br>shredded cheddar<br>salt and pepper to taste<br><br><br><br>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                In a large pot over medium heat, combine broth, corn, onion, leeks, chives and potatoes. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat, cover and simmer 15 to 20 minutes, until potatoes are just tender.  (I used a potato masher to smash the potatoes a bit in order to thicken the broth.) Season with salt and pepper.<br>    Stir in cubes of cream cheese until melted.  Garnish with shredded cheddar and serve at once.<br>
