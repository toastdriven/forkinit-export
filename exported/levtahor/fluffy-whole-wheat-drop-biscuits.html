            These are my favorite biscuits to make because they are so easy and fluffy.  I make my biscuits larger so the recipe actually yields 8.

                1 c buttermilk or 1 c milk &amp; 2 tbsp lemon juice<br>2 c whole wheat flour<br>2 tsp baking powder<br>Â½ tsp baking soda<br>1 tsp sugar<br>1 tsp sea salt<br>8 tbsp (1 stick) melted and cooled slightly (about 5 min.)<br>2 tbsp melted butter for brushing biscuits [optional]

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. Heat oven to 450 degrees.<br>2. mix the lemon into the milk. set aside and allow to curdle, about 5 minutes. Keep cold<br>3. run baking powder, baking soda, sugar, and salt through sifter<br>4. stir flour, baking powder, baking soda, sugar, and salt in large bowl.<br>5. add melted butter to milk mixture; stir until butter forms small clumps.<br>6. add milk mixture to dry ingredients and stir until just incorporated and batter pulls away from sides of bowl forming a sticky ball. Add tablespoon of milk if dough is too dry. be careful not to overmix, as that will give you a less fluffy biscuit.<br>7. spoon batter into approximately 1/4 cup portions and drop onto parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet, about 1 1/2 inches apart. bake until tops just begin to brown and become crisp, 12 to 14 minutes.<br>8. brush biscuit tops with melted butter, if you like. transfer to wire rack to cool.
