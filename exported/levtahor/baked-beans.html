Drain and rinse before using.<br>Place the beans in a large saucepan cover with a couple inches of water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender.<br>Preheat an oven to 375 degrees. Stir all of the sauce ingredients together in a large bowl and set aside (not including the onion).<br>Drain the beans and pour them into a large lidded casserole dish and stir in the chopped onion and the molasses sauce. Add water to cover beans completely.<br>Cover the baking dish, and bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes, then reduce the heat to 200 degrees, and cook 6 hours longer. Stir the beans after they have cooked for 3 hours. Once the sauce has reduced and is sticky, remove from the oven, stir, recover, and allow to stand 15 minutes before serving for hot baked beans.  Refrigerate for cold baked beans.
