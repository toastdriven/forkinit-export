                Preheat oven to 350. Butter a 9 inch cake pan. To make topping, in small bowl, mix flour, sugar and cinnamon. Blend in butter, using your fingertips or a pastry blender until mixture is crumbly. Set aside. To make the cake, in large bowl, beat together egg, milk and butter. Sift flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and mace into a small bowl. Add to egg mixture. Beat until just blended. Gently stir in the blueberries. Spread batter evenly in prepared pan and sprinkle with the topping. Bake until a wood toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes. Serve warm from the pan. <br><br>NOTE:  Ground nutmeg may be substituted for the ground mace.
