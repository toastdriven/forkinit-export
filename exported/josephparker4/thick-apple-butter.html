            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                If you will be canning the apple butter, get suitable jars, lids and rings ready. In a large pot or water bath canner, cover jars with water and boil 10 minutes. Turn off heat.<br>Place the lids in a small pan and cover them with water. Bring the water to a full boil and then turn the heat off. Leave the lids in the water until ready to place on the jars.<br>Peel, core, and cut up the apples. Combine with the cider or water and cook until the apples are soft.<br>Add sugar, salt, spices, and if using, the juice and zest from a lemon.<br>Continue to cook over low heat, stirring frequently to prevent sticking until the mixture is very thick. (Test by scooping up a heaping spoonful. The mixture should keep its rounded shape and not flatten out.)<br>To process: using tongs, remove a jar from the hot water, fill it to 1/2 inch from the top with apple butter, wipe the rim clean and retrieve a lid from the hot water.<br>Put the lid on, screw on a ring just until snug. Return the filled jar to the pan of hot water. Continue until all jars are filled and/or the butter is gone.<br>Return the pan of filled jars to the stove. Add more hot water if necessary to completely cover jars, then cover the pot and bring to a boil. Boil for 10 minutes.<br>Allow to cool somewhat (or completely); carefully remove jars to a dry surface. Cool completely before removing sealing rings. Check for seals following lid manufacturer&#x27;s instructions. Freeze any that don&#x27;t seal or refrigerate and use within a week.<br>If you don&#x27;t want to bother with canning, just freeze the apple butter in quantities that you can use within a week. Remove from freezer as needed and allow to thaw in the refrigerator.
