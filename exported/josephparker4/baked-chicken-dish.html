            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Cook chicken in water until done, I use chicken parts.  When done remove chicken from bones and cut up.  Let it cool a little first.  Mix all the ingredients together in a bowl.  Place in a greased baking dish.  (Too much liquid is better than not enough.  Otherwise the rice will be hard.)  Place in refrigerator overnight.  Bake with tin foil on top at 350 for about an hour (or more).  Crush the cornflakes, I usually end up with about a cup to a cup and a half of crushed flakes, and then melt the butter and mix together.  Remove the foil and sprinkle on the top.  Bake another 15 minutes to a half-hour.
