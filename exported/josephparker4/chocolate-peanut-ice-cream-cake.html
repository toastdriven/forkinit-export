            Crunchy chocolate-covered peanuts separate layers of vanilla and chocolate ice cream in this scrumptious frozen dessert. Starting with a crumbled cookie crust and ending with a delicious peanut butter and fudge sauce, this ice cream treat is surprisingly simple to make. Best of all, this cake can be prepared ahead and kept in the freezer until you need it. Serve slightly softened with extra fudge sauce.<br>
