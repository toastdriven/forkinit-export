            Pretty much the basic when it comes to pizza dough. Work in your own spices and variants.

            <h3 class="underline">Ingredients</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                4 cups bread flour / all purpose flour (white)<br>1 1/4 cups lukewarm water<br>2 1/4 teaspoons (1 packet) active dry yeast<br>2 tablespoons olive oil, extra virgin is best<br>1 teaspoon salt<br>1 teaspoon sugar or honey<br>1/4 cup more milk or water (milk adds flavor)
            </p>
        </div>

            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                In a liquid measuring cup pour in the warm water, sugar/honey, and yeast. Stir it up, it should foam a little, and set it aside for several minutes.<br><br>In another larger mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt.<br><br>Wait a few more minutes for the yeast mixture to do its thing.<br><br>Now, mix the yeast mixture, along with the extra milk/water into the flour bowl, and add the olive oil. Stir together using a wooden spoon or just clean hands.<br><br>Sprinkle a layer of flour on an open clean surface, and some on your clean, dry hands; then drop the dough on the flour and fold it in half about 40 times - you should now have a pretty smooth elastic rubbery dough ball.<br><br>Drop it in a bowl, wash your hands, wet them with olive oil and rub over the top of the dough to keep it from drying out. Drape a towel over the bowl and let it sit for 30 minutes to an hour.<br><br>Lightly oil your pizza pan, or sprinkle flour on it, or cornmeal. Whatever you&#x27;re in the mood for.<br><br>Take the dough out and flatten it out on your pizza pan. Feel free to try the old spinning trick you&#x27;ve always wished you could do - it&#x27;s easier than you&#x27;d think. ;)<br><br>Just as a reminder for your memory, here are some typical things you&#x27;d put on the pizza dough at this point:<br><br>+ Pizza sauce or any pasta sauce you think would work<br>+ Shredded mozzarella cheese, parmesan cheese<br>+ Green bell pepper<br>+ Pepperoni<br>+ Italian sausage<br>+ Mushrooms<br>+ Ham<br>+ Onions<br><br>Baking should take about 12-14 minutes, but keep your eye on it.
