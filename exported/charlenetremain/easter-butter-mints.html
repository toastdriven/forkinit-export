            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                In a large bowl, beat butter until creamy. With mixer on low, add sugar (sift it so there are no lumps) to the butter along with cream and extract until creamy and smooth.<br><br>Turn dough out onto a work surface lightly dusted with powdered sugar; knead until smooth and satiny. Divide mixture into thirds: Tint one-third pastel pink with 1 drop red food coloring, one-third pastel green with 1 drop green and one-third buttery yellow with 1 drop yellow. Cover each portion with plastic wrap to keep it from drying out as you work.<br><br>Line 2 baking sheets with nonstick foil. Lightly dust work surface with powdered sugar. Working with one color at a time, roll out ¼ cupfuls of the dough, using your fingers, into a ½-inch-thick rope. Cut rope into ½- to ¾-inch pillows. Transfer mints to prepared baking sheet with a spatula. (Be careful—mints are soft and will squish easily). Repeat with remaining mint mixture.<br><br>Let air-dry at room temperature for 2 days until firm enough to handle. Transfer mints to covered containers.<br><br>Storage Tip: Store in a container that won&#x27;t allow moisture to become trapped inside at cool room temperature up to 2 weeks.<br><br>5 mints = one serving<br>Per serving: 62 calories, 0 protein/0 fiber, 11 g carbohydrates, 2 g fat (1 g saturated fat), 6 mg cholesterol, 15 mg sodium<br>
