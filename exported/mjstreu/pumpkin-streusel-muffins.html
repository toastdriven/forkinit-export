            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Preheat oven to 400Â° F. Line twelve muffin cups with paper liners or lightly grease the tin.<br>Make the streusel:<br>In a medium bowl, combine all ingredients and rub the butter in until the mixture is crumbly. This will be a bit of a sticky operation because the butter is soft, but take your time. Once it is crumbly, gently squeeze bits of the mixture together to form larger pieces of crumble/streusel. Set aside.<br>Make the muffins:<br>In a large bowl, combine melted butter, pumpkin, yogurt/sour cream, eggs, and vanilla and whisk until smooth.<br>In another large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, spices and salt, then stir in the sugar. Add pumpkin mixture to flour mixture and sir until just combined. Divide batter evenly between the prepared muffin cups and top with streusel.<br>Bake for 16-19 minutes at 400F, until a tester inserted into the center of the muffins comes out clean.<br>Cool muffins in the pan for about 5 minutes to allow the topping to set up, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.<br><br>
