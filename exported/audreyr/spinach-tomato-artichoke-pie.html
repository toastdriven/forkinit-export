                1 small container of spinach leaves<br>2 tomatoes (I used large roma)<br>1/2 onion<br>2/3 c artichoke hearts (frozen or canned; I like the ones that come in a jar marinated in garlic oil)<br>1 1/2 cans tomato soup<br>1 whole wheat olive oil pie crust (see my other recipe)

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Make the pie crust (see other recipe).  Roll out 2 circles of dough.  Press one of them into a pie tin and flash bake at 425 degrees for 10 min or until lightly browned.  <br><br>Slice tomatoes and onion into circles 3/16&quot; thick.<br><br>Remove pie crust from oven.  Alternate layers of tomato soup, spinach leaves, onions, tomatoes, ending with spinach as the top layer.  Be generous with the layers of spinach leaves, as they&#x27;ll shrink down significantly during baking.  Press everything down and add more until piled as high as possible.<br><br>Place in oven for 10 min, to let the spinach shrink down.  <br><br>Remove pie and add top pie crust.  Decrease temperature to 375 degrees and bake for 35-50 minutes or until dark brown but not burnt.  (You may need to cover the edges with foil if using an aluminum tin)
