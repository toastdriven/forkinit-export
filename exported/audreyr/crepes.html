            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                For the batter:<br>Place ingredients in blender/bowl in order given. <br>Measure flour and liquid carefully, since consistency of batter is important.  (It should be about the consistency of thick heavy cream.) Spoon flour into 1 cup measure and level off with straight edge of knife or spatula. <br>Blend 30 seconds, stop and scrape down sides. Blend 30-60 seconds until smooth. Or, mix in bowl with wire whisk or mixer, first combining flour and eggs, adding liquid.<br>Batter can be used immediately.  However, an hour or two standing will produce slightly more tender crepes.  Or, refrigerate batter up to three days for use as needed.<br><br>For the crepes:<br>Pour it into dipping pan. <br>Dip the crepe maker. <br>Pull it out and wait for it to cook (30 ish seconds) and shake it onto a plate. Done. <br>Then fill it with all the goodies.
