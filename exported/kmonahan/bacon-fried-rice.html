            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1.5 cups (uncooked cups) of day/hours-old rice [Note: use slightly less (1/8-1/4 cup) water than you usually do when cooking. The later you cook the rice, the less water you use]<br>Package of frozen mixed veggies (1lb recommended, less ok)<br>2 tsp Ginger garlic paste<br>Strips of bacon (4-10, ~0.5lb, whatever you have), cut to small 1/4&quot; pieces.<br>Eggs (3-6, whatever you have)<br>Optional: whatever veggie you have left over (4 stalks of celery chopped, or small onion chopped, or half a bag of spinach coarsely cut, no carrots)<br><br>Whatever spices you have, I suggest:<br>  soy sauce<br>  sugar<br>  garlic powder<br>  onion powder<br>  white pepper<br>  black pepper<br>  sesame oil<br>  anything chinese<br>  never tried worcestershire but try it

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Crack the eggs in a bowl and add a few drops of soy sauce, a few drops of evoo, and around 1/8-1/4 tsp of salt. Whisk with fork.<br>Heat stove to med-hi and add small amount of evoo.<br>Scramble the egg to fingertip size. <br>Put the egg back to the egg-whisking bowl (no need to wash the bowl, you will re-cook the egg anyway)<br><br>Heat the stove again and heat bacon, without evoo.<br>When bacon browns and/or curls a little, add frozen veggies, ginger garlic paste and veggies<br>When veggies are done, turn heat to super low.<br>Add rice, using your hand to crumble the rice before adding. This saves you work later.<br>Use the spatula to break up the rice.<br>Add egg. Put heat back up to low/low-med.<br>Add all the spices and mix very well (write down whatever amount you use for later reference), keep tuning until you like it.
