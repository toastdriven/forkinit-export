            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. In a heavy bottomed pan combine the cream, milk and haddock. Bring to a gentle simmer. Take the pan off the heat and allow to infuse at room temperature until cool.<br>2. In another pan, cook pancetta in 1/4 cup olive oil over low heat until the pancetta has shrunken in size, given off a little of its fat, and turned a light brown. Add onions, celery, carrots, black pepper and 2 teaspoons of salt. Cook over medium heat for about 35 to 40 minutes<br>3. Add the potatoes to the pancetta and vegetables. Cook for about 10 minutes over low heat, then strain the cream into the vegetables. Flake the haddock into large chunks. Discard all skin, bones, and any dry bits. Add haddock to chowder, give a good stir and turn the heat down to low. Cook until the potatoes are tender (approximately ten minutes), checking and stirring intermittently so they do not burn. Just before serving, stir in chopped parsley, remaining olive oil, ground chili, and lemon juice.<br>4.

You want to pull all the smoky flavors out into the cream. This will result in a deeply rich soup. Once you make this you will never go back to another chowder.<br>- Cooking the vegetables is the most valuable step. As the vegetables cook more and more they will give off a sweet soft flavour which is very Italian (even though this isn&#x27;t close to being an Italian dish). Think low and slow.
