                2 chicken breasts<br>2 cups whole grain pasta, such as rotini or penne or even wagon wheels (more or less according to taste)<br>1/2 bag frozen peas and carrots, or frozen vegetables of your choice<br>2 cans condensed cream of whatever soup--I use cream of chicken but have had good results with cream of celery--DO NOT reconstitute.

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Boil water for pasta.  Add pasta to water, let that cook as directed while cooking the rest.  Cut up chicken into 1 inch (or less) cubes and cook through in a skillet.   When chicken is cooked through, drain any liquid and add frozen vegetables and soup.  Heat everything through.  Drain pasta, add to rest and enjoy.
