                <br>1 Tablespoon butter<br>1 Tablespoon olive oil<br>2-3 leeks (the white parts only, sliced very thin)<br>2-3 potatoes, scrubbed, quartered and sliced thin.<br>2-3 carrots,  sliced in half lengthwise, then chopped pretty fine.<br>2 cloves garlic, minced.<br>4 cups vegetable stock (If I don&#x27;t have any, I cheat and use water and 2 veggie bouillon cubes.)<br>1 can chick peas.  (Rinsed)<br>Parsley if you have it.

            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Put the olive oil, butter and leeks into a heavy bottomed pot, stir until the butter melts, put the flame on medium low, and put a lid on it.<br>Go wash and slice the carrots and potatoes. <br>Stir the leeks after 5 minutes. <br>At the 10 minute mark, add the potatoes and carrots, and maybe turn the heat up a little.  Stir, cooking until they&#x27;re almost tender, then whack in the garlic, and stir for about 2 more minutes. <br>Add the chick peas, and cook, stirring for a minute or two.<br>Add the stock and parsley (if you&#x27;re using it) and bring the soup to a simmer.<br>Simmer until the potatoes and carrots are fully soft (this will be less than 15 minutes) then either eat it the way it is, or - for a really creamy soup (that has no cream) puree one cup of the soup and add it back.  (I always puree, but I have an immersion blender that makes it a snap.)
