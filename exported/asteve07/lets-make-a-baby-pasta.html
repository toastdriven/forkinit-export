            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Kosher Salt<br>3/4 # penne<br>2 T. olive oil<br>2 garlic cloves, minced<br>1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes (or slightly more for spicier results)<br>1 14-oz can diced or crushed tomatoes (preferably San Marzano)<br>1/4 c. grated Pecorino Romano or Parigiano-Reggiano cheese

            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                In a large pot, bring water to a boil and add a large pinch of salt.<br><br>Add the penne to the pot and cook according to package instructions until al dente. Set aside 1/2 c. of cooking liquid, then drain and reserve the pasta in a serving bowl.<br><br>Meanwhile, in a large skillet, heat the oil over moderate heat. Add the garlic and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, for about 30 seconds, being careful not to let the garlic brown. Add the tomatoes and crush them with the back of your spoon (leaving the sauce a bit chunky). Simmer until warmed through, about 10 minutes. Add salt to taste. (Sauce will keep for up to three days in the fridge.)<br><br>Scrape the tomato sauce into the serving bowl with the pasta and toss to cat. Sprinkle the cheese on top and serve--with red wine and candlelight!
