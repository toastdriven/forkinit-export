                1 (15 ounce) package refrigerated pie crusts<br>1/4 cup strawberry jam, divided<br>2 cups confectioners&#x27; sugar<br>2 tablespoons milk<br>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract<br>1 tablespoon colored decorating sugar, or as needed

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.<br><br>Unroll the pie crusts, place on a lightly floured work surface, and roll the crusts slightly with a rolling pin to square the edges. <br><br>Cut each crust into 8 equal-sized rectangles. <br><br>Place about 2 teaspoons of strawberry jam in the center of 8 squares, and spread the jam out to within 1/4 inch of the edge of the pastry square. <br><br>Top each with another pastry square, and use a fork to crimp the squares together, sealing in the jam.<br><br> Use a knife to trim the pastries, if desired. Move the filled pastries to the prepared baking sheets.<br><br>Bake in the preheated oven until the edges are lightly golden brown, about 7 minutes. <br><br>Allow to cool on the baking sheets. <br><br>Meanwhile, stir together the confectioners&#x27; sugar, milk, and vanilla extract in a bowl to make a spreadable frosting. Spread the cooled tarts with frosting and sprinkle with colored sugar.<br><br>Calories: 398 | Total Fat: 16.3g | Cholesterol: &lt; 1mg
