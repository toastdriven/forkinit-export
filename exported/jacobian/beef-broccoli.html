            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Combine steak and soy sauce and marinate while you prep the rest of the ingredients.<br>Whisk together sake, broth, oyster sauce, suger, oil, and cornstarch.<br>Combine garlic, ginger, and 1 1/2 teaspoons oil.<br>Heat a splash of oil in a large cast iron skillet (or some other heavy cookware) until smoking. Add half the steak and cook, stirring as little as possible, until the beef is browned around the edges, about 1-2 minutes. Remove the steak, add more oil, then repeat with the other half.<br>Add the garlic/ginger mixture and cook until fragment (15-30 seconds) then add the broccoli. Cook another 30 seconds or so, then add the water. Cover the pan and steam until the broccoli is just cooked (it should still be a bit toothsome).<br>Return the beef (along with any juice it&#x27;s released) to the pan and add the sauce. Cook, stirring well, until the sauce is thickened.<br>Serve with the scallions as a garnish.
