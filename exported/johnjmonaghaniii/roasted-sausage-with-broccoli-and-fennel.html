            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Heat oven to 425Â° F. <br>Combine broccoli florets and sliced fennel in a shallow casserole or baking dish. You want them to fit snugly in a single, even layer. <br>Season with salt and pepper. <br>In a small bowl, whisk together olive oil, whole-grain mustard, lemon juice and zest, and Aleppo pepper. <br>Add to broccoli and fennel and toss well to coat evenly. <br>Nestle the pieces of sausage among the broccoli and fennel. <br>Roast for about 20 minutes, or until the broccoli and fennel are tender and the sausage is no longer pink. <br>For extra security, you can toss about halfway through the cooking time to ensure even cooking. <br>Optional but highly recommended: Heat broiler, and place the pan under the broiler for a few minutes to crisp the sausage and slightly char the broccoli and fennel in spots. Taste and add more salt, pepper, or lemon juice if needed. <br>Serve warm or at room temperature.
