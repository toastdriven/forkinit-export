                Better Instructions soon. <br><br>Make meatballs according to recipe, but instead of cooking in a pan, just put them on a lightly greased baking sheet and put them in the oven at 425 until browned and cooked through (about 30min)<br><br>Add all sauce ingredients to a small pot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to simmer, whisk in cornstarch/water mixture and simmer until thickened (about 15min)<br><br>Heat oil on high in wok or frying pan<br>add vegetables and keep them moving for a few minutes (the goal is to leave them with some bite to them. They should be crisp)<br>Remove from heat and add noodles to pan. <br>Toss with vegetables for 30 seconds. <br>Add sauce.<br>Toss and transfer to a plate to cool. <br><br>Serve noodle mixture with meatballs on side/top.  <br><br><br><br>
