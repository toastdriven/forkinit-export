            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Preheat oven to 350Â°F. <br>Season short ribs with salt and pepper. <br>Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. <br>Working in 2 batches, brown short ribs on all sides, about 8 minutes per batch. Transfer short ribs to a plate. <br>Pour off all but 3 tablespoons drippings from pot.<br>Add onions, carrots, and celery to pot and cook over medium-high heat, stirring often, until onions are browned, about 5 minutes. <br>Add flour and tomato paste; cook, stirring constantly, until well combined and deep red, 2-3 minutes. <br>Stir in wine, then add short ribs with any accumulated juices. <br>Bring to a boil; lower heat to medium and simmer until wine is reduced by half, about 25 minutes. <br>Add all herbs to pot along with garlic. <br>Stir in stock. Bring to a boil, cover, and transfer to oven.<br>Cook until short ribs are tender, 2-2 1/2 hours. <br>Transfer short ribs to a platter. <br>Strain sauce from pot into a measuring cup.<br>Spoon fat from surface of sauce and discard; season sauce to taste with salt and pepper. <br>Serve in shallow bowls over mashed potatoes with sauce spooned over.<br><br>Cooks&#x27; note: To test if the ribs are done, pull on a bone. It should slide out freely.
