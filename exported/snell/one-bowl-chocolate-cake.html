            I Love Chocolate Cake-especially when it’s made from scratch. However, I hate doing dishes. Fortunately, this one-bowl recipe is here to save the day whenever I crave chocolate cake!

            <h3 class="underline">Ingredients</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                2 cups all-purpose flour<br>2 cups sugar<br>1/2 cup baking cocoa<br>2 teaspoons baking soda<br>1 teaspoon baking powder<br>1/2 teaspoon salt<br>1 cup vegetable oil<br>1 cup buttermilk*<br>2 eggs<br>1 cup hot water<br>Frosting<br>Sprinkles (completely optional)

            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Directions:<br>Preheat oven to 350 degrees.<br>Grease a 9x13-inch pan, set aside.<br><br>In a large bowl, combine all dry ingredients. Mix in the oil, buttermilk, and eggs. Once the eggs are fully incorporated, pour in the hot water and mix well (your batter will seem runny, but I promise that it will work out!).<br><br> pour batter into prepared pan. Bake for 33-38 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the middle of the cake comes out clean. When the cake is completely cool, top with frosting and decorate with sprinkles (if so desired). <br><br>*Don’t have buttermilk? No worries! It’s simple to make your own!<br>Take one cup of milk and add 1 tablespoon of vinegar to the milk. Stir it up and let it sit for about 5 minutes. Use immediately.
