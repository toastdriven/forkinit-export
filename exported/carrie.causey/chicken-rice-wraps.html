            Melissa Borsman&#x27;s recipe as made by her daughter Bethy when she flew out to help me with new baby Anya!  Easy to make, and keeps really well in the fridge for quick and easy lunch or dinner.

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. Cook chicken with your choice of seasonings until done.  Sprinkle on the packet of Ranch and add the vinegar and cook until liquid is gone (turn on your stove fan and watch your eyes!)  Add chicken to a REALLY BIG bowl.<br>2. While chicken is cooking, cook the rice + water until it is done.  Add to bowl.  Add all the diced veggies to the bowl and toss until well blended.<br>3. Refrigerate until cold.  Toast tortilla shells in a skillet (dry or with EVOO spray) until softened.  Spread wrap with ranch dressing and fill with chicken &amp; rice!<br><br>I think this recipe would be awesome with the addition of corn and black beans in the mix, and salsa with the ranch on the wrap and cheese sprinkled on top!
