                Add sausage to medium frying pan and brown for 5 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon to a bowl lined with paper towels (this removes some of the extra grease). Add the chicken pieces and brown half pound at a time. Remove with the slotted spoon and set aside with the sausage. In a small stock pot add onion, peppers, peas and carrots and cook, stirring to prevent them from burning, for about 10 minutes. Stir in the flour and cook an additional 5 minutes, continue to stir frequently. Add the tomatoes and chicken broth and bring to a boil. Add the sausage and chicken, stir well and season with Creole Seasoning. Cover and simmer gently for 40 minutes. Serve over rice if you like, but I like it without the rice the first day. This recipe makes enough for 2 people to have 1 meal of Gumbo and 2 meals of Gumbo Risotto. <br><br>Notes:<br>*You can use fresh garlic, salt, pepper and chili powder if you want, but the Creole Seasoning is really a perfect blend of those and much less expensive.<br><br>When Sugar Snap Peas are in season, I enjoy using them as they give a little extra flavor.<br><br>You can use a food processor to speed up the chopping, but I really enjoy doing the chopping by hand.*
