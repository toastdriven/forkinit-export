            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                For the Gelatin:<br>3 tbsp unflavored gelatin<br>1/2 c cold water<br><br>The sugary concoction:<br>2 c sugar<br>3/4 c cane sugar syrup<br>1/2 c cold water<br>1/4 tsp salt<br><br>The rest:<br>2 tbsp vanilla<br>Powdered sugar<br>butter (or vegetable oil)<br><br>Hardware:<br>A standmixer or the strongest arms in the world.<br>Candy or digital thermometer

            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Mix the gelatin and cold water together and let stand for 1 hour. It works will to mix it in the standmixer bowl. It will turn into a rubbery/silicone-y substance over the hour.<br><br>Bring the sugar, syrup, water, and salt to a boil and cook till it reaches the firm ball stage (244Â°F). Do not stir as that can led to it crystallizing which is bad. It turns a light amber color and is very dangerous. Melted sugar equals napalm so treat it carefully.<br><br>Remove the sugar from the heat and pour slowly over the gelatin. Beat in the mixer for 15 minutes on high. It will get thicker and thicker and strain the motor in the mixer.<br><br>When thick but warm, about 10 minutes of mixing, add the flavoring.<br><br>Grease a pan with butter (or vegetable oil) and spread the mix into pan. It helps to coat everything with butter i.e. your hands, the spatula, and all other utensils. You will lose about 1/3 of the mix because it sticks to everything. But it cleans up easy since it is just sugar and dissolves.<br><br>Dry for 12 hours.<br><br>After it has dried, cut it into any size you want and dust it with powdered sugar (or corn starch, but powdered sugar is so much better!).<br><br>Go forth and eat.<br>
