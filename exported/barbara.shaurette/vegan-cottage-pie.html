            Interesting note: Cottage and Shepherd&#x27;s Pie are essentially the same thing - ground meat and some vegetables under a crust of mashed potatoes.  It&#x27;s only called Shepherd&#x27;s Pie when it&#x27;s made with ground lamb.

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                For the potatoes:<br>Peel the potatoes and cut into 1/2-inch dice. Place in a saucepan, cover with water, bring to a boil over high heat.  Simmer until fork tender, approximately 10 to 15 minutes. Drain the potatoes and then return to the <br>saucepan. Mash the potatoes with the almond milk, margarine, salt and pepper until smooth.  Stir in the egg substitute until well combined.<br><br>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.<br><br>While the potatoes are cooking, prepare the filling. Melt margarine in a 12-inch saute pan over medium high heat. Add the (fake) ground beef, salt and pepper and cook until browned and cooked through, approximately 3 minutes.  Add the frozen vegetables and continue to cook, stirring constantly, for another 3 minutes.  Add the garlic and stir to combine.  Add the vegetable broth, Worcestershire, rosemary, thyme, Bisto and stir to combine. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer slowly 5-8 minutes or until the sauce is thickened slightly.<br><br>Spread the meat mixture evenly into an 11x7-inch glass baking dish, or a round pie pan.  Using a rubber spatula, smooth the mashed potatoes over the top, starting around the edges to create a seal to prevent the mixture from bubbling up.  Once the dish is completely covered, run a fork across the top to draw ridges in the potatoes.<br><br>Bake for approximately 25 minutes (or just until the potatoes begin to brown and crisp). Cool for about 10 minutes before serving.
