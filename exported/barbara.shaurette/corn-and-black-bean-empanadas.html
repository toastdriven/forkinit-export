            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. To make Crust: Sift flours, salt, and chili powder into a bowl. Mix in margarine with fingers until mixture resembles coarse meal. Whisk together applesauce, vinegar, and 1/3 cup cold water in a separate bowl. Stir applesauce mixture into flour mixture until texture dough forms, adding up to 1/4 cup more water if necessary. Knead on lightly floured surface until dough comes together. Form into ball, wrap in plastic wrap, and chill 1 hour, or overnight.<br><br>2. To make Filling, heat oil in large skillet over medium-high heat. Add beans, corn and garlic, reduce heat to medium, and cook 3 minutes. Stir in cumin, cayenne, and coriander, and cook 2 minutes. Remove from heat, and stir in red pepper sauce.<br><br>3. Preheat oven to 400F. Divide dough into 12 balls. Coat baking sheet with cooking spray. Roll out each ball to 6-inch round (1/4-inch thick) on lightly floured work surface. Fill with approx. 3 Tbs. filling and brush edges of pastry with water. Fold dough circle in half, press to close, trim excess dough and crimp edges with fork to seal.  <br><br>4. Transfer to prepared baking sheet, and repeat with remaining dough balls and filling. Chill 10 minutes. Brush a little oil on top of the pastries before baking to give them some crunch. Bake empanadas for 20 minutes, or until golden brown and crusty. Cool 5 minutes on baking sheet before serving.<br>
