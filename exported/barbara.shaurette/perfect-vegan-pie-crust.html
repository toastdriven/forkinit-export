                3 cups whole wheat pastry flour<br>1 teaspoon salt<br>3/4 cup margarine<br>5 to 6 tablespoons cold water <br>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. In a medium bowl with fork, lightly stir together flour and salt.<br><br>2. With pastry blender or two knives used scissor fashion, cut in margarine until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.<br><br>3. Sprinkle in cold water, a tablespoon at a time, mixing lightly with a fork after each addition until pastry just holds together.<br><br>4. With hands, shape pastry into ball (if it&#x27;s a hot day you may have to refrigerate the dough for 30 minutes or so).<br><br>5. For a two crust pie, divide pastry into 2 pieces, one slightly larger, and then gently shape each piece into a ball.<br><br>6. On lightly floured surface with lightly floured rolling pin, roll larger ball into a 1/8 inch thick circle, 2 inches larger all around than pie plate.<br><br>7. Roll half of circle onto rolling pin; transfer pastry to pie plate and unroll, easing into bottom and side of plate. Fill as recipe directs.<br><br>8. For top crust, roll smaller ball as for bottom crust; with sharp knife, cut a few slashes or a design in center of circle; center over filling in the bottom crust.<br><br>9. With scissors or sharp knife, trim the pastry edges, leaving 1 inch overhang all around the pie plate rim.<br><br>10. Fold overhang under; pinch a high edge. Bake pie as recipe directs.<br>
