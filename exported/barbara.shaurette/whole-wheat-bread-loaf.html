            Makes enough dough for at least four 1-pound loaves.  The recipe is easily doubled or halved.  My instructions are for a stand mixer, but you can just as easily mix by hand.<br>

            <h3 class="underline">Ingredients</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                7 cups whole wheat flour<br>1-1/2 Tbsp granulated yeast (or 2 packets)<br>1 Tbsp salt (increase or decrease to taste)<br>1/4 cup vital wheat gluten<br>3-3/4 cups lukewarm water<br>
            </p>
        </div>

            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Whisk together the flour, yeast, salt and vital wheat gluten in a mixing bowl.<br><br>Add the water and mix without kneading, using a dough hook on the stand mixer.<br><br>Drape the mixing bowl with a clean cotton cloth and allow the dough to rest at room temperature until it rises and collapses, approximately 2 hours.<br><br>The dough can be used right away, but it&#x27;s easier to handle when cold.  Refrigerate it in a lidded (not airtight) container and use it over the next 10 days.<br><br>On baking day:<br><br>Dust the surface of the refrigerated dough with flour and cut off a 1-pound (grapefruit-sized) piece - this should be 1/4 of the dough if you&#x27;ve made the full batch.  Dust the piece with more flour and quickly shape it into a ball by stretching the surface of the dough around to the bottom on all four sides, rotating the ball a quarter turn as you go.<br><br>Allow the loaf to rest, loosely covered with plastic wrap, on a baking tray lined with a silicone mat, for 90 minutes (40 minutes if you&#x27;re using fresh, unrefrigerated dough).<br><br>Thirty minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 450F.  Place an empty broiler tray or other deep baking tray on the bottom rack of the oven.<br><br>Just before baking, use a pastry brush to paint the top of the loaf with water.  Use a serrated bread knife to slash the top of the loaf with 1/4-inch-deep parallel cuts.<br><br>Slide the baking tray into the oven.  Pour 2 cups of tap water into the heated broiler tray and quickly close the oven door.<br><br>Bake for about 30-35 minutes.  Allow the bread to cool on a rack before slicing and eating.<br>
