            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                7 cups whole wheat flour<br>1-1/2 Tbsp granulated yeast (or 2 packets)<br>1 Tbsp kosher salt<br>1/4 C vital wheat gluten<br>3-1/2 C lukewarm water<br>1/2 C olive oil

            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Whisk together the flour, yeast, salt and vital wheat gluten in a mixer bowl.<br><br>Add the liquid ingredients and mix without kneading, using the dough hook attachment.<br><br>Cover (not airtight) and allow the dough to rest for approximately two hours, until it rises and collapses.<br><br>Refrigerate in a lidded (notairtight) container.<br><br>On baking day: dust the surface of the refrigerated dough and cut off half of the original piece.  Dust with more flour and shape into a ball by stretching the surface of the dough around to the bottom on all four sides, rotating the ball a quarter turn as you go.<br><br>Elongate the ball into a narrow oval.  Allow the loaf to rest, loosely covered with plastic wrap, on a silicon mat for 90 minutes.<br><br>Thirty minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 450.  Place an empty broiler tray on any other rack that won&#x27;t interfere with the bread.<br><br>Just before baking, put the dough into a large loaf pan.  Use a pastry brush to paint the top with water.  Slash the loaf with 1/4-inch deep cuts, using a serrated bread knife.<br><br>Slide the loaf pan into the hot oven.  Put about 1-2 cups of water into the broiler tray and quickly close the oven door.<br><br>Bake for about 30 minutes.  Allow the bread to cool on a rack before slicing and eating.
