            This is actually not as labor-intensive as it looks at first glance.  Make the enchilada sauce while the sweet potatoes are cooking, and mix up the guacamole while the enchiladas are baking.

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Guacamole<br><br>1. Mash everything together in a bowl. Taste, add more salt, garlic powder, or lime juice as needed.<br>2. Store in an airtight container in the fridge until ready to eat.<br><br>Enchilada Sauce (Adapted from Veganomicon):<br><br>1. In a large saucepan, over medium heat, saute the garlic, onions and chile peppers in coconut oil until soft (about 4-7 minutes).<br>2. Add the remaining sauce ingredients, bring to a simmer and remove from heat.<br>3. When the sauce mixture has cooled, taste and adjust salt if necessary.<br>4. Puree in blender until mixture is smooth.<br><br>Sweet Potato and Black Bean Filling<br><br>1. Peel and cube the sweet potatoes. Bring a pot of water to a boil and boil sweet potatoes until tender, about 20 minutes.<br>2. Drain sweet potatoes and place back in pot.<br>3. Over medium heat, add the black beans and garlic and about 1/4 cup of veggie broth. Cook until veggie broth is absorbed, mashing the sweet potatoes and black beans.<br>4. Keep adding veggie broth 2 tablespoons at a time and mashing the sweet potato and black bean mixture until you have a fairly smooth mixture. It does not have to be pureed but there should be no more large chunks of sweet potato left. Once the mixture is at the desired consistency and all the veggie broth has been absorbed, turn off the heat and add the rest of the ingredients. Taste and adjust seasoning if needed.<br><br>To Assemble the Enchiladas:<br><br>1. Preheat oven to 375degF. Get out a large rectangular baking pan.<br>2. Take each tortilla, spread with sweet potato and black bean filling and roll up. Place in baking pan.<br>3. Once you are done filling the tortillas, pour the enchilada sauce over the top.<br>4. Cover and bake for 25 minutes. Then uncover and bake for another 20 minutes.<br>5. Remove from oven and allow the enchiladas to cool for about 10 minutes.<br>6. Serve topped with a gracious dollop of guacamole.
