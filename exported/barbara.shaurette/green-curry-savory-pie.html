            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Slice and drain the zucchini and eggplant ahead of time.  Cut the zucchini in half lengthwise and then crosswise into 1&quot; chunks; set aside.  Cut the eggplant into 1&quot; chunks.<br><br>Preheat oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.<br><br>In a medium saucepan or heavy skillet, bring 1/2 of the coconut milk to a gentle boil over medium-high heat. Cook for 2 minutes, until it begins to thicken and becomes fragrant. Add the curry paste and cook 2 minutes, pressing and stirring to dissolve it into the coconut milk.<br><br>Add the remaining coconut milk, the vegetable broth, zucchini and eggplant, soy sauce, brown sugar, corn starch and about half the wild lime leaves, if using, and bring to a gentle boil. Reduce heat to maintain a lively simmer and cook, stirring now and then, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the remaining lime leaves and the basil.<br><br>Pour the mix from the saucepan into the bottom crust. Cover with the top crust and crimp the edges. Also make a few slits on top of the crust so the steam can escape.<br><br>Bake 35 minutes, until golden brown.  Let cool at least 10 minutes before serving.<br>
