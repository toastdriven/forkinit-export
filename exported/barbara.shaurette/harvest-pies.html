            These little pies are too labor-intensive for a weeknight meal, but so worth it for a weekend dinner when you have a long afternoon to prep ingredients.

            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Pie Crust:<br><br>1. Whisk dry ingredients together, then cut margarine into the dry ingredients until it resembles coarse bread crumbs.<br><br>2. Whisk flax seed into the water, then add to dry ingredients. Work into a soft dough with a fork and then your hands.<br><br>3. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for at least 1/2 hour.<br><br>Pies:<br><br>Preheat oven to 400 degrees<br><br>1. Toss butternut squash, cranberries, and shallots in the olive oil.  Season with salt and pepper and roast in the oven on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper for 30-40 mins, or until golden brown. <br><br>2. While squash is roasting, heat olive oil and margarine in a large saucepan over medium-hi heat.  Add veggies and garlic and the 1 tsp sage and turn to coat all the veggies with the oil.  Season with salt and pepper, then reduce heat to medium and cover.  Cook for 15-20 mins, stirring regularly, until veggies are cooked and golden.  Remove lid, add wine, and cook until reduced.   <br><br>3.  Add braised veggies to the pan of roasted squash.  Sprinkle poultry spice over top and gently toss together.  Adjust seasonings to taste.  Set aside to cool.<br><br>Reduce oven to 375 degrees<br><br>4. Remove pastry from the fridge and cut off 2/3rds.  Return 1/3 to the fridge.  Roll out dough on a well-floured surface to between 1/8 to 1/4 inch thickness.  Cut the dough into circles, big enough to fit your muffin tin with some hang over.  For example, my muffin tins have sections with a 3.25 inch diameter, and I found that a circle of pastry dough with a 5 inch diameter fit perfectly.  Make sure there is a lip of dough so you can attach the top crust on.<br><br>5. Mould the pastry into the muffin tin, making sure it is an equal thickness.  Fill with cooled veggie filling, mounding it up as much as you can.  <br><br>6. Roll out the remaining pastry dough and cut to the right size to make a top crust for each pie.  Press the top crust on to the lip of dough from the bottom crust.  Cut venting holes/slits in the top and bake for 35-40 mins, until golden.<br><br>7.  Let cool for 5 mins, then gently remove from the muffin tins.  I found it easiest to gently place a cooling rack upside on top of the pies, then invert the rack and the muffin tin at once (like getting a cake out of a pan).  Once out of the tin, serve the pies (right side up) with gravy.
