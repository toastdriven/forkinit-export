            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Line a baking tray with the kitchen foil.<br><br>Cut the zucchini in half, down the middle.<br><br>Scoop out the pulp with a teaspoon. Set aside or compost. If you like zucchini cake, this is a great time to bake one to use up the pulp!<br><br>Arrange each scooped-out zucchini on the foil-lined baking tray. Leave the hollow facing up.<br><br>Prepare the stuffing. Heat the oil in a frying pan. Add the onion and carrot and cook for 3 minutes, stirring frequently.<br><br>Pour half of the can of chopped tomatoes into the frying pan. Bring to a boil.<br><br>Add the quinoa. Cover the pan and reduce the heat. Simmer for 12 minutes but keep an eye on it in case the quinoa soaks up all of the liquid.<br><br>Once the quinoa is tender, add the spinach and nuts. Cover again and simmer for 2 more minutes. The spinach should appear wilted.<br><br>Remove the mixture from the heat. Spoon into each zucchini boat evenly.<br><br>Add the topping to each zucchini boat. Spoon over the remaining chopped tomatoes. Sprinkle the top with cheese or breadcrumbs and olive oil.<br><br>Turn the oven to 400ºF. Slip in the baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes or until the zucchini is tender.<br><br>Remove from the oven and serve. Just before serving, sprinkle a little parsley over each boat. Bon appétit!
