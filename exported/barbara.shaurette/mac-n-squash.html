                16 oz pasta of your choice<br>1 medium butternut squash (about 2 to 3 cups, once roasted/mashed)<br>1-1/2 cup unsweetened and unflavored almond milk<br>1/4 medium yellow onion<br>2 cloves of garlic (or more to taste)<br>1 tsp arrowroot powder<br>salt to taste<br>1 tsp turmeric (optional)<br>+/- 1 cup cheddar Daiya<br>

            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Heat oven to 375 F, cut squash in half, remove seeds, brush lightly with olive oil, and roast for 40 minutes or until done (should be very soft). You can also peel the squash and cut into cubes, and roast the cubes if you are short on time.<br><br>Spoon the squash out of the peel (unless you peeled it and cubed it already), discard the peel. You should get somewhere between 2 and 3 cups of squash mash. Set aside.<br><br>Cook the pasta, set aside when done.<br><br>While the squash and pasta are cooking, dice the 1/4 onion and garlic.  Saute onion and garlic together with a little olive oil for 5 or 10 minutes until onions are soft and slightly caramelized. Remove from heat and set aside.<br><br>In a medium saucepan, bring 1-1/2 cups almond milk to a simmer (not boiling), add arrowroot powder and turmeric.  Stir continuously until the mixture thickens. Remove from heat and set aside.<br><br>Throw everything but the pasta into a blender (or into a mixing bowl, and use a stick blender).  Blend it all together, scraping down the sides to make sure everything fully incorporates.  Add a little almond milk if necessary and keep blending until the mixture is the consistency of yogurt.  Add salt to taste.<br><br>Mix in the pasta; add vegan cheese (optional).<br><br>Spoon the mixture evenly into a 8Ã—14 baking dish (or similar), and bake for 30 or so minutes at 375 F, until the top starts to brown a little. Remove from oven, and serve right away.<br>
