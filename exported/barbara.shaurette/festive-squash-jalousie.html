            This is basically a savory pie.  A &quot;jalousie&quot; is a sort of louvered window.  Apparently the name does originate from the word &quot;jealousy&quot; &quot;because such blinds afford a view while hiding the viewer&quot;.  It is also the name for a pastry dish that has vents cut in the top to resemble such louvering.

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Heat oven to 400.<br><br>Toss the squash in a roasting pan with the garlic, rosemary and thyme leaves. Drizzle with 2 tbsp oil. Roast for 40 mins or until soft and starting to brown. Remove and squeeze the garlic out of its skin, mash and gently mix with the squash, then set aside to cool.<br><br>Heat remaining oil in a small pan and fry the onion until soft and lightly golden. Add the mushroom and fry for 3-4 mins more. Remove from heat and set aside. In a large bowl, mix the chestnuts, herbs, fake cheese, and nutmeg. Stir in mushrooms and squash mixture, taking care not to break up the squash too much. Season well. <br><br>Roll half of the pastry into a rectangle sized to fit the bottom and sides of an approximately 10&quot; x 5&quot; bread or loaf pan.  <br><br>Pile the filling into the pan and carefully lay the uncooked pastry on top, pressing down the edges to seal.  Bake for 30-35 mins until the pastry is <br>golden, risen and cooked through.
