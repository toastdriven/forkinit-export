                Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 425 degrees F. Line two baking sheets with foil or parchment paper, and spray with non-stick cooking spray. Set baking sheets aside.<br><br>Clean and dice new potatoes. Try to slice them so they&#x27;re just about all the same size. Place in a large bowl.<br><br>In a small bowl, whisk together mustard, olive oil, melted margarine, minced garlic, lemon juice, zest, and salt. Pour mustard mixture over diced potatoes. Toss until potatoes are coated. Divide the coated potatoes between the two baking sheets. Sprinkle with black pepper. Leave any extra mustard mixture in the bowl. It will just burn in the oven.<br><br>Bake potatoes for 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and toss. Return to the oven and bake for another 25 minutes, or until the potatoes are browned and cooked through. Remove from the oven, toss with parsley, and serve warm.
