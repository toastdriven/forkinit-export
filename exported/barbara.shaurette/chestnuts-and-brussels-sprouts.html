            In years past, I&#x27;ve followed this recipe to the letter, starting with whole, raw chestnuts, boiling and peeling them by hand, and every year I end up with raw, red fingers.  Peeling the chestnuts is not easy.  This year I&#x27;m going to try jarred chestnuts, pre-steamed and peeled.  I have a feeling that the flavor will not be quite as rich, but it might be worth it to save all that wear and tear on my hands.

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Use a paring knife to cut an X in the flat side of each chestnut shell. Toss into a pot of boiling water and cook for 10 minutes. Peel away the outer shell and brown skin. Return the peeled chestnuts to the pot of water and boil until tender, about 25 minutes.<br><br>Blanch the Brussels sprouts in boiling salted water for about 8 minutes or until they are just tender. Take care not to over cook. Drain the Brussels sprouts well and cut in half lengthwise. Melt butter in a skillet and saute the shallots. Add the chestnuts and Brussels sprouts, toss to coat with the butter. Season with salt, pepper and nutmeg. Cook for 5 minutes until heated through.
