            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1 box of Pepperidge Farm puff pastry, thawed overnight<br>1 bar of vegan chocolate, grated<br>soy milk (or other non-dairy milk) for glazing
            </p>

            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Preheat oven to 350F.  Grease a large baking sheet (or lay out a Silpat liner).<br><br>Onto a lightly floured surface unfold the pastry into two large squares.<br><br>Brush each square with soy milk and sprinkle grated chocolate on top - one bar of chocolate grated should be enough to split between the two pastry sheets.<br><br>Roll up the pastry, jelly roll style. As you do so, brush the pastry with soy milk to help seal it together.<br><br>Turn the rolled pastry seam side down and glaze the whole thing with soy milk.<br><br>Slice each roll into pieces about 1&quot; wide and place onto the baking sheet leaving a large space between each.<br><br>Cook for 15 â€“ 20 minutes or until golden brown. Leave to cool on a wire rack.
