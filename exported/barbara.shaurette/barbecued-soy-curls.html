            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                In a large mixing bowl, blend nearly boiling water with bouillon and<br>poultry seasoning until bouillon has dissolved. Add dehydrated Soy<br>Curls and, using the back of a large spoon, press into the water<br>mixture until they are all covered. Let Curls sit for 10 minutes.<br>Drain them in a colander, pressing them firmly with your hands or the<br>back of a large spoon to squeeze out as much excess water as possible.<br><br>Heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium heat, 3 to 4 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon vegetable oil, shaking the pan until the entire cooking<br>surface is lightly coated. When oil starts to shimmer add the Soy<br>Curls, distributing them evenly around the pan so that they brown<br>evenly and don&#x27;t just steam.<br><br>Cook Soy Curls 5 to 7 minutes, using a spatula to turn them every few<br>minutes. As Curls cook, sprinkle with garlic granules and a little<br>pepper. If pan starts to look dry and Curls begin sticking, add some<br>of the remaining 1 tablespoon vegetable oil, tossing the Curls to<br>evenly distribute the oil. Add barbecue sauce, tossing Curls to coat<br>evenly. Continue cooking 1 to 2 minutes more, until sauce begins to<br>caramelize but not burn. Taste the Curls and season with additional<br>salt and pepper, if needed.
