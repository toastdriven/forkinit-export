            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Fry the ground &quot;beef&quot; in the oil for a few mins (keep the bottle handy - you may need slightly more oil to cook with as the vegan ground has naturally less fat than real beef).<br><br>Tip in the tomatoes and herbs. Fill one of the empty cans with water, add this to the beef mixture, then bring to a boil. Simmer for 20 mins.<br><br>Tip half the spinach into a colander and pour boiling water over it to wilt, then repeat with the second half. Squeeze out as much moisture from the spinach as you can, then leave to drain in the colander. When the beef is almost ready, cook the gnocchi, then drain.<br><br>Preheat the oven to 350.<br><br>Stir the gnocchi and spinach into the beef, season, then tip into a large ovenproof dish. Tear the mozzarella into chunks, scatter over, then cook in the oven for about 20 mins. until golden and bubbling.
