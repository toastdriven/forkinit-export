            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                For the dough:<br><br>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and sugar. Gently cream the margarine into the flour mixture. 1 tablespoon at a time, add the ice water while gently turning and mixing the dough with your hands. If the dough is not coming together, add the last tablespoon while continuing to mix the dough. When the dough forms a rough ball, turn it out onto a large piece of plastic wrap. Form the dough into a round disc, tightly wrap it in plastic wrap, then refrigerate for at least 1 hour.<br><br>Prepare Rosemary Pesto: Combine Rosemary through nuts in a food processor. Mix until well blended. Slowly drizzle in olive oil until it reaches the desired consistency.<br><br>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.  Line a baking sheet with parchment paper (or spray with cooking spray).<br><br>Roll the galette dough into a 12-inch round.  Transfer the dough to the baking sheet.  Spread the Tofutti (if using) over the surface of the galette dough, leaving a 1-1/2 to 2-inch border at the edges.  Follow by spreading the Rosemary pesto.  Arrange the squash/zucchini over the top, leaving the border at the edge.  Rotating the galette, fold the border up over the filling, pinching and crimping shut at regular intervals.<br><br>Bake the galette in the center of the oven for 30-40 minutes, until the squash is browned and roasted and the dough edges have browned.<br><br>Can be served warm, cold, or at room temperature.<br>
