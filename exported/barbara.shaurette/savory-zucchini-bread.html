                Prepare the yeast mixture: In a small bowl, mix the dry yeast with 1 tsp sugar and a few tablespoons of water. Mix well and set aside for 15 min.<br><br>Meanwhile grate the zucchini and set aside.<br><br>Sieve 4 cups of flour into a bowl, add salt and thyme. Make a well in the middle and add the yeast mixture. Gently mix the flour with yeast mixture and slowly keep adding the rest of the water. Mix to form a dough. Transfer to a board and knead for 5-10 min until smooth.<br><br>Transfer to a bowl, cover and leave in a warm place for 40 minutes to rise.<br><br>Squeeze out the excess water from the zucchini.<br><br>When the dough has doubled in size, transfer it to a board and incorporate zucchini into the dough. The dough will become more watery so keep adding flour, spoon by spoon until the consistency is fine to work with. It shouldn’t take more than 4 tablespoons. Knead for 2-3 more minutes.<br><br>Form a loaf and transfer to a loaf pan. Cover and again leave in a warm place for 40 min to rise.<br><br>After that time preheat the oven to 375°F, brush bread with olive oil and bake 30-35 min.
