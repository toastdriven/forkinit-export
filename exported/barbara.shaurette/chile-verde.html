            After a week-long vacation through California that involved a lot of quality Mexican meals, I decided to attempt my own at home.<br><br>Don&#x27;t be afraid of the number of chiles in this recipe - they&#x27;re balanced out by the tomatillos, and after 2-3 hours of cooking, most of the spice is cooked out - the flavor is actually quite mild.<br><br>We served this chile inside burritos initially, accompanied by seasoned rice (steamed in a rice cooker with vegetable stock instead of water, mixed with diced tomatoes, pinto beans and taco seasoning after cooking) and beans (canned pinto beans, drained and rinsed, then heated in a sauce pan with some of the liquid from the chile).  The plan is to use the leftover chile on top of veggie burgers next.
