            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Spray a 8 x 8 non-stick square cake pan with cooking spray.<br><br>Place the oats, shredded coconut, dates, and salt into a food processor and process for a minute or two until everything is flour-like consistency. Add almond meal and pulse 4 to 5 times to combine. Next add the coconut oil and pulse until it just starts to come together as a dough. Sprinkle this mixture evenly into the prepared pan. Then use your fingers to gently press the crust down, leveling as needed. Make sure it is pressed in pretty well and then transfer to the oven. Bake for 10-15 minutes until the edges are golden. Set pan on a wire rack to cool to room temperature.<br><br>When crust has cooled, place the 2 cups coconut milk into a medium saucepan and sprinkle the agar flakes on top. Let sit for a few minutes then add the lemon juice, zest, agave, vanilla, turmeric, and salt. Whisk to combine. Bring mixture to a slow boil. I used medium heat to achieve this. Once the mixture comes to a rolling boil, set a timer for 10 minutes. Reduce heat a bit (medium-low), and let the mix boil for 10 minutes, whisking frequently to keep agar from sticking to the pan. After 10 minutes remove from heat and whisk in the yogurt. Pour this mixture carefully over the top of the cooled crust and place pan in the fridge to set. I let mine set for about an hour. Then remove it to serve or cover with plastic wrap and place back in the fridge to enjoy later. These are best kept chilled, but can also be served at room temperature. Cut bars into 2&quot; squares, this makes 16 evenly sized lemon bars.
