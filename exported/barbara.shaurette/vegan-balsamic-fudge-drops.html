            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1 cup unbleached white flour (or use gluten-free baking flour)<br>1/2 teaspoon baking soda<br>1/8 teaspoon salt<br>5 tablespoons Earth Balance margarine<br>1/2 cup plus 1 tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder (not Dutch-process)<br>2/3 cup granulated sugar<br>1/3 cup dark brown sugar<br>1/3 cup soy yogurt<br>1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br>1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar<br>Vanilla sugar<br>
            </p>
        </div>

            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Preheat oven to 350 F. Cover two baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.<br><br>Mix the flour, soda, and salt together and set aside. In another bowl, mix the cocoa with the sugars and set aside.<br><br>Melt the margarine in a medium-sized saucepan. When it is completely melted, take it off the heat and add the sugar/cocoa mixture and stir to combine. Then add the soy yogurt, vanilla extract, and balsamic and stir until mixed. Finally, add the flour mixture and stir just until it’s combined—don’t over-mix.<br><br>Using a cookie scoop or tablespoon, drop tablespoons of the dough onto the baking sheets about 1 1/2-inches apart. Sprinkle lightly with vanilla sugar, and place them in the oven. After 5 minutes, switch the pans around so that the one on top is on the bottom and the front sides are in the back. Check again in 4 minutes. Be careful—depending on the type of pan you use, they can go from underdone to burned in seconds (I found out the hard way!) They shouldn’t need more than 11 minutes and will look soft on top, but they’ll harden as they cool.<br><br>Remove from the oven and transfer onto cooling racks. Makes about 2 dozen cookies.<br>
