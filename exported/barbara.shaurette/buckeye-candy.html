            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Mix together peanut butter and softened margarine until smooth.  Stir in vanilla extract, cardamom, and sea salt.<br><br>Using a mixer or immersion blender, incorporate the confectioner’s sugar 1 cup at a time until crumbles form.<br><br>Take a large pinch of the dough and form into 1-inch balls. Place each onto a cookie sheet and insert a toothpick into the center.<br><br>Chill in the freezer for about an hour. This prevents the toothpicks from sliding out while dipping.<br><br>Using a double boiler, melt your chocolate until smooth. Remove the peanut butter balls from the freezer and carefully swirl the ball into the chocolate. Place onto wax paper and repeat until all are covered.<br><br>Let stand at room temperature until chocolate has firmed up. Remove toothpicks and seal over the tiny hole in the middle.<br>
