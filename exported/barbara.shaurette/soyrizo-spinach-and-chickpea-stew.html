                In a medium saucepan, cover the chickpeas with 2 inches of water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for about 10 minutes. Drain the chickpeas and reserve 1 cup of the cooking water.<br><br>In a medium casserole or stockpot, heat the olive oil. Add the garlic and cook over moderate heat until the garlic begins to brown, about 7 minutes. Add the tomatoes and cook over moderately high heat until sizzling, about 4 minutes. Add the chorizo, the chickpeas and their reserved cooking water and the tomato juice and bring to a simmer. Stir in half of the spinach and cook until wilted, then stir in the remaining spinach. Simmer over moderately low heat for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Season with salt and pepper.
