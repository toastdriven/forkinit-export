            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Preheat the oven to 350º.<br><br>Melt the butter in a sauce pan then mix in the graham crackers and sugar if using.  Press the mixture into the bottom of a pie tin or springform pan then set aside.<br><br>For the cheesecake part 1 mix the softened cream cheese, sugar, vanilla, lemon juice, cardamom &amp; egg replacer with a handmixer or a tabletop mixer to whip it well then set aside the bowl.<br><br>For the cheesecake part 2, mix the pumpkin, pumpkin pie spice, maple flavoring, cardamom, salt, sugar, creamer and egg replacer with a handmixer or a tabletop mixer to whip it well then set aside the bowl.<br><br>Pour half of the cheesecake part one onto your prepared crust.  Pour half of the pumpkin mix into a storage bowl and freeze for the next time you make this cheesecake.  Then talk half of what is left and place it in dollups across the top usually a tablespoon amount at a time separated by about an inch.  With a butter knife swirl the two together making sure to make it pretty :-) .  Repeat this process with the rest of each part.  I do it in two parts because you would have too much pumpkin to make a nice swirl doing it all at once.<br><br>Place in the preheated oven and bake for 45-55 minutes until the sides begin to pull away and it starts to crack a bit.  Allow to cool for 30 minutes and then refrigerate for 3-4 hours to set up well.  I usually make it the night before so it is ready for dinner the next day or you could do the morning for dinner too.<br><br>Prepare the cranberry sauce an hour before you want to eat your cheesecake.  Place all the ingredients into a pan and bring to a boil then reduce heat to a simmer for 5 minutes stiring well so you don’t burn it.  Then mash half or more of the cranberries with a fork and remove from the burner to cool until you eat.<br><br>When you are ready to eat it use a wet butter knife to cut loosen the sides of the cheesecake, rewetting when needed.  Do the same for when you cut it to get nice pieces that don’t break apart or pull up half of the slice.  Top with cranberry sauce if desired and ENJOY!  YUM.
