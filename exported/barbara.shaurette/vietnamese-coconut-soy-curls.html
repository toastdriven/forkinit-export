            The recipe this was adapted from featured pork as its main ingredient - I&#x27;ve been experimenting and had some good luck lately with getting a pork-like flavor out of my soy curls, using a combination of seasoned instant gravy and liquid smoke/Bragg&#x27;s aminos. This meal is really rich - be sure to have some steamed vegetables or a salad on the side.

                To prepare the soy curls: Empty the bag of soy curls into a wide, shallow bowl (like a small casserole dish).  Boil 3 cups of water, mix it with the Bisto, liquid smoke, Bragg&#x27;s aminos, and pour over the soy curls.  Let the mixture soak for about 10 minutes.<br><br>Drain the soy curls.  Heat the sesame oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add in the soy curls, toss with salt and pepper, and cook until slightly browned.<br><br>Combine the minced garlic, minced shallot, soy sauce, granulated sugar, ground ginger, Chinese 5 spice, red pepper flakes, and lemon juice in a bowl, then pour over the browned soy curls. Stir to combine, then add in the coconut milk and stir to combine. Cover, reduce the heat to medium-low, and cook for about 30 minutes, stirring every so often to prevent burning.<br><br>Remove the lid of the pot, stir, and allow to cook for another 30 minutes or so, allowing the sauce to reduce a bit. Taste and adjust seasoning as necessary. Serve over rice and garnish with a few thinly sliced scallions.
