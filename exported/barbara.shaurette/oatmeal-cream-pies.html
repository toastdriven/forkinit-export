            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Preheat oven to 350 degrees.<br><br>Cream together the Earth Balance and both sugars. Add the molasses, vanilla, and flax eggs, and beat on medium until incorporated. Then add the rest of the ingredients to the mix. It’s important that you do not over whip the mixture; the dough will be lighter if either your butter was too soft, or you mixed it too long.<br><br>Scoop out cookies onto cookie tray (about 2 tbsp, each), and flatten (this is a thick dough, so they won&#x27;t spread much during baking - flatten them down as much as you can). Bake for 10-14 minutes. Do not over bake or they will be crispy when they cool. Move cookies to a rack to cool completely.<br><br>While the cookies are cooling, make your filling. Mix all the ingredients on low until incorporated, then beat on medium-high for about 5 minutes for a fluffy cream. Once your cookies are completely cool, either scoop the filling on to the cookies with a spoon or ice cream scoop, or pipe it on with a piping bag and decorative tip. Don’t spread the filling all the way to the edge of the cookie, because when you sandwich them together, it will spread on it’s own.  Tip: Let the cookies &quot;set up&quot; for up to an hour, or until the icing has firmed up.<br>
