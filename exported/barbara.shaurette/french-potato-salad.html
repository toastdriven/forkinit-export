                1 1/2 lbs small new red skinned potatoes, scrubbed but not peeled, cut into cubes<br>1/2 cup plus 2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil<br>3 tbsp white wine vinegar<br>2 tbsp dry white wine<br>salt and freshly ground black pepper<br>2 shallots, finely minced<br>chopped fresh parsley<br>snipped fresh chives<br>

            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Steam potatoes, covered, in a vegetable steamer over simmering water just until tender, about 20 minutes<br><br>Meanwhile, whisk together 1/2 cup of the oil, 2 tablespoons of the vinegar, the wine, and 1 tsp of salt in a bowl large enough to fit the potatoes (and toss them without making a mess).<br><br>Remove the potatoes from the pot and combine with the oil and vinegar mixture; toss gently. Set aside to allow the potatoes to absorb the dressing, about 20 to 30 minutes.<br><br>Meanwhile, in a small bowl, make the final dressing. Whisk together the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, the remaining 1 tablespoon vinegar, the parsley, shallots, and chives to taste in a small bowl until thoroughly blended.<br><br>After the potatoes have had time to absorb the oil and vinegar mixture, add the herbed dressing mixture to the potatoes and toss gently. Season to taste and serve.
