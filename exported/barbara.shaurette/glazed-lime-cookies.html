            I found this cookbook on the sale shelf at Powell&#x27;s, and so far this is the only recipe I&#x27;ve tried from it, but I&#x27;m impressed so far.  These cookies are deelish - not too sweet, a nice light texture, perfect to go with tea.

                Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.<br><br>In a large bowl, beat together margarine and canola oil until fluffy.  Add the powdered sugar, and bring the mixture back to a fluffy consistency.  Add the lime zest, lime juice, lemon zest, and vanilla extract, and beat until even once again, about 1 minute.<br><br>Add the flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt and mix until well incorporated.<br><br>Drop by spoonfuls onto a parchment-lined baking sheet and bake for 9-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly browned.  Transfer to a cooling rack and let cool completely before glazing (about 15 minutes).<br><br>For the glaze: In a medium saucepan, combine all the ingredients over medium heat.  Add just enough water to achieve a pourable consistency.  With a paper towel under the cooling rack to catch drips, spoon a fair amount of glaze over each cookie.  Let cool completely before storing.<br>
