            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                The Potatoes:<br>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees fahrenheit, and coat two baking sheets with cooking spray.<br><br>In a large bowl, combine the potatoes, oil, salt, pepper, paprika, and parsley. Mix everything together with your hands, making sure all the potatoes are thoroughly coated.<br><br>Divide the potatoes between the two baking sheets, and roast at 400 degrees for 45 minutes to an hour, stirring occasionally, until crisp and brown.<br><br>While that&#x27;s happening, make the red sauce.<br><br>The Red Sauce:<br>In a saucepan, saute the onion in the oil over medium heat for about 5-7 minutes, until softened and golden.<br><br>Add the garlic and cook another minute.<br><br>Add the canned tomatoes (including liquid) and all the seasonings except the sherry and vinegar.<br><br>Stir to combine, bring to a boil, and then lower the heat to simmer and cook for about 30 minutes, stirring often, until the sauce has reduced to thick, dark, deliciousness.<br><br>Add the sherry and the balsamic vinegar, stir to combine, and remove from heat.<br><br>The Yellow Sauce:<br>In a saucepan or the microwave, heat the soy milk, saffron and cashews to nearly boiling and allow to sit for at least 30 minutes before blending in a food processor until completely smooth.<br><br>In a saucepan, melt the margarine over low heat, then add the garlic. Saute briefly, then add the flour to make a roux.<br><br>Raise the heat to medium, then begin gradually adding the blended cashew/soy milk mixture, stirring continually.<br><br>Add the lemon juice, salt, tarragon, and Garlic Mash. Cook for about 5-7 minutes, continuing to stir, until thickened; if it gets too thick, add a little water or soy milk to get the consistency you like.<br><br>To serve:<br>Ladle some red sauce onto a warmed plate, arrange potatoes on top, and spoon on some of the yellow sauce. Top with a sprinkle of cilantro or parsley and serve immediately.
