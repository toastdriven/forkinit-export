            A standard muffin tin works just fine if you don&#x27;t have a dozen ramekins laying around.  Just be sure to fill the cups only halfway with batter.

                1-3/4 cups all-purpose flour<br>1-1/2 tsp baking powder<br>1/2 tsp salt<br>10 Tbsp margarine (Earth Balance)<br>1/2 C light brown sugar<br>3/4 C granulated sugar<br>Zest of half a lemon<br>1 tsp vanilla<br>2 flax eggs<br>2/3 C soy milk<br>3/4 C fresh blueberries<br>1/4 C pecans, lightly toasted and finely chopped

            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Preheat oven to 350.  Butter and flour ten 6 oz. ramekins and set aside. <br><br>In a small bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, and salt. Whisk to combine and aerate. Set aside.<br><br>Cream together the margarine, sugars, lemon zest and vanilla until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, scraping down the bowl after each addition. While mixing on low speed, add a third of the dry ingredients. Follow with half the soy milk, then another third of the dry ingredients, the other half of the soy milk, and the final third of the dry ingredients. Continue to mix until well combined.<br><br>Fold in the blueberries. Divide the batter among the 10 molds, filling each half way. Sprinkle the pecans over the cakes. Bake until light golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean - about 25-30 minutes. Cool the cakes in their molds for 5-10 minutes before turning out and cooling completely on a wire rack.
