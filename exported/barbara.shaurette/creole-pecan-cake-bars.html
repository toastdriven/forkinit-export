            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Preheat oven to 300°F. Coat the bottom and sides of a large (17-by-12-inch) baking sheet with cooking spray, then line with parchment paper.<br><br>Sift ﬂour, baking powder and salt together in a medium bowl. <br><br>Cream margarine and sugar in a mixing bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed. Add egg substitute gradually and beat until creamy. Add vanilla and beat until combined.<br> <br>Add half the ﬂour mixture to the creamed mixture and stir until well combined. Add cinnamon and nutmeg; stir until blended into the mixture completely. Add pecans, raisins and dates to the rest of the ﬂour mixture.  (Coating the dried fruit and nuts helps distribute them in the mix.) Stir the ﬂour-coated fruit and nuts into the batter. Do not overstir. Evenly spread the batter into the prepared baking pan with a spatula. (Coat the spatula with cooking spray, if necessary, to make spreading easier.)<br><br>Bake for 45 minutes. Run a knife around the edges of the pan to loosen the sides. Cool in the pan on a wire rack for 45 minutes. Invert onto a large cutting board and remove the parchment. Cut into squares.
