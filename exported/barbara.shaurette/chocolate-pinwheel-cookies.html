            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Cream together margarine and sugar until smooth.  Add almond extract, prepared flaxseed meal and baking powder.<br><br>In separate bowl, whisk together flour and salt.  Gradually mix into the wet ingredients until well incorporated and slightly crumbly.  Gradually add the 2 tsp almond milk, mixing until the dough clumps together into one or two balls.  Chill briefly in freezer; while dough is chilling, mix together cocoa powder and sugar to make filling.<br><br>Once dough is chilled, cover a workable area with flour.  Place dough in the center and gently roll out into about an 8&quot;x12&quot; rectangle.  To make sure it will roll up nicely, gently slide a spatula underneath to loosen.<br><br>Once you have your rectangle rolled out, sprinkle generously with sugar mixture (you may have some of the filling mixture left over).<br><br>Now, firmly grasp the dough and roll up lengthwise, gently squeezing to keep taut as you go along.  Pinch the edges slightly to keep the roll closed.<br><br>Transfer to a baking sheet lined with wax paper and chill in the freezer for about 15 minutes.<br><br>Preheat oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit.<br><br>Using a sharp knife, cut 1/2&quot; sections from the roll.  Place slices on an ungreased cookie sheet; bake for 8 minutes.<br><br>Transfer to a wire rack and let cool thoroughly before eating.<br><br>Once they are cool, feel free to drizzle a little melted chocolate on top for added yumminess.<br>
