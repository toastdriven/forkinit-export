                2 lbs. butternut squash (any kind of winter squash is fine), peeled and cut into 3/4&quot; cubes<br><br>6 cups strong vegetable broth<br>1 tsp. saffron threads<br><br>2 tbsp. olive oil<br>2.5 cups arborio rice<br>1/2 cup dry white wine<br>8 oz. fresh baby spinach (about 4 cups)<br>2 tbsp. Earth Balance or other vegan margarine<br>1/3 cup vegan parmesan or nutritional yeast

            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Preheat the oven to 375 degrees fahrenheit.<br><br>On a baking sheet, coat the cubed squash in a little olive oil, then sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cook at 375 degrees for about 30 minutes, tossing once around the middle of the roasting time, until the squash is brown and quite tender. Remove from the oven and set aside.<br><br>Pour the stock into a pot and place over medium heat. Keep it very hot while you cook the risotto, but be careful to reduce heat if it comes close to a boil.<br><br>Toast the saffron by placing it in a metal spoon, then set it over a low flame to toast until fragrant. Add the toasted threads to the simmering broth.<br><br>In a large, heavy-bottomed pot, heat the olive oil and saut√© the onion over medium heat until softened but not browned, about 7-10 minutes. Depending on how salty your stock is, you may or may not want to add a teaspoon of salt at this point.<br><br>Turn the heat to medium-high, and add the rice. Stir constantly for a couple of minutes, until the grains are coated and giving off a toasty aroma.<br><br>Add the wine, stirring constantly until it has been absorbed and making sure to scrape up any bits that have stuck to bottom of the pan.<br><br>Ladle in about a cup of the stock, and stir constantly until the liquid is absorbed. Continue this way until all of the stock has been added and the rice is creamy, but still has a bit of a bite to it.<br><br>Stir in the roasted squash and the spinach, and cook another minute or two.<br><br>Add the Earth Balance, the vegan parm, and a few grinds of black pepper.<br><br>Mix thoroughly, remove from heat, and serve immediately.
