            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. Turn on the broiler. In a large bowl, mix 1 tbsp. oil, the garlic, and 1/4 tsp. each salt and pepper. Add kale and toss to coat well. Arrange on a baking pan in a single layer and broil until slightly browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Set aside to cool.<br><br>2. Brown tofu in a few tp of sesame oil, in a medium saucepan over medium heat, about 4 minutes.  Transfer tofu to small bowl, leaving about 2 tbsp of oil in the pan.<br><br>3. Add rice to pan, reduce heat to medium, and cook, stirring, until rice starts to toast slightly, 1 to 2 minutes. Add onion, 1/2 tsp. salt, and 1/4 tsp. pepper; cook until onion is softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Add enough broth to just cover rice; cook, stirring constantly, until liquid is absorbed. Continue adding broth to just cover rice and stirring until it&#x27;s barely tender, 15 to 18 minutes. If needed, add more broth so risotto is loose-textured; it will thicken a bit as it stands.<br><br>4. Remove risotto from heat and loosely fold in tofu, mozzarella, walnuts, margarine, and tomatoes. Fold in most of kale and spoon into a serving dish. Top with remaining kale and serve immediately.
