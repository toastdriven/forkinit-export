                2 1/4 cup powdered sugar, sifted<br>1 1/2 Tablespoons agave nectar(or any liquid sweetener)<br>1 1/2 Tablespoons water<br>1 Tablespoon coconut oil, softened or melted<br>1 teaspoon peppermint extract<br>1 bag(12oz) bittersweet or semisweet chocolate chips

            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                In a large bowl, mix the powdered sugar, agave nectar, coconut oil, peppermint extract, and water. Continue mixing with your hands even if it doesn’t look like there’s enough moisture there; eventually it will all come together and form a dough ball.<br><br>Take off chunks of filling from the dough ball and roll them into 3/4-inch balls. Press the balls down in between your hands and form patties. Lay these out on a baking tray and refrigerate or freeze for 30 minutes until firm<br><br>When the patties are ready, melt down the chocolate in a microwave or over a double-boiler. Line a baking tray with parchment paper to set the peppermint patties to dry once coated.<br><br>To coat, lay the patty down on top of the melted chocolate. Immediately flip it over with a fork and lift it out of the chocolate from the bottom. Wipe off any excess chocolate from the bottom and lay it on the lined baking tray.<br><br>Let the patties sit at room temperature for an hour or refrigerate for 10 minutes before removing them from the paper.
