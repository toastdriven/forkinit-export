                Place 3 c. flour in mixing bowl &amp; make well in center. Pour water in well; then add yeast, salt, sugar &amp; bakihng powder to water. Stir slowly, adding flour from edges of bowl a little @ a time, until all water mixture has absorbed &amp; dough is soft but not sticky. May need to work in enough of remaining 1/2 c. flour so dough isn&#x27;t sticky.<br>Place dough on lightly floured surface, knead gently about 1 min. Place in greased bowl &amp; turn to grease top. Cover &amp; allow to rise until almost doubled in bulk, about 30 min. Heat oil over medium to medium-high heat (ready when pinch of dough immediately rises to top.)<br>Cut dough into 8-10 pieces &amp; stretch until 1/4-1/2 inch thick &amp; 3-4 in. in diameter. Drop a few @ a time into hot oil. Fry about 1 min. on each side, until dough is puffed up &amp; browned. Drain on paper towels. Serve with butter &amp; cinnamon &amp; sugar or honey.
