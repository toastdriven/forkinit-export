                Broil peppers 2 inches from heat for about 15 minutes, turning often, till all sides are blistered. Place peppers in a paper or plastic bag.  Close bag and let stand about 10 minutes or till cool enough to handle.<br><br>Meanwhile, make tomato sauce.  In blender container combine UNDRAINED tomatoes, onion, bouillon granules, pepper, and cinnamon.  Cover; blend till smooth.  Transfer to a saucepan.  Heat to boiling: simmer, uncovered, for 5 minutes.  Cover and keep warm over low heat while preparing peppers.<br><br>Peel peppers; remove stems and seeds.  Stuff each pepper with 1/2 C of the cheese or 1/2 C hot Picadillo.  Set aside.  Slightly beat egg yolks and water.  Add flour and salt; beat 6 minutes or till thick and lemon-colored.  Beat egg whites till stiff peaks form.  Fold yolks into whites.<br><br>In a large heavy skillet heat 1/2 inch fat to 375 degrees.  For each serving spoon about 1/3 C egg batter into hot fat, spreading batter in a circle.  Fry 3 or 4 at a time.  As batter begins to set, gently top each mound with a stuffed chili.  Cover with another 1/3 C batter.  Continue cooking 2 to 3 minutes more, till underside is brown.  Turn carefully; brown second side.  Drain on paper toweling; keep warm in 300 degree oven while preparing remainder.  Serve with tomato sauce; garnish with snipped cilantro or parsley.  Makes 8 servings.<br><br>About this recipe:  The chilies in the recipe title are poblano chilies, large, mild-flavored green peppers available in Mexican markets.
