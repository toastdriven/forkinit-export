                 Rub poblanos with peanut oil and place under broiler until skin begins to blacken slightly, and rotate for even cooking. Remove from broiler and place in a plastic bag or in a bowl and cover with plastic. This will allow peppers to sweat so skin can be removed. Keep in bag for approximately 30 minutes. Remove skin by peeling, stem can remain on. Slice open pepper on its side and remove seeds and membranes. Bring potatoes up to a boil in salted water and cook on simmer until tender.<br><br>Remove and hand mash with 1 1/2 tablespoons butter, scalded cream, salt and pepper and grated cheese.<br><br>In a saute pan add 1/2 tablespoon butter and saute corn kernels quickly with salt and pepper approximately 30 seconds on high heat. Add to potato mixture.<br><br>Begin to fill peppers with potato mixture, being careful so as not to break flesh.<br><br>Place on a sheet tray, top with shredded cheese and melt under broiler.
