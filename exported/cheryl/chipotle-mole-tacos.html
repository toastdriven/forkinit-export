                 In a bowl, mix the ancho and pasilla chiles and the hot coffee. Cover and let stand at room temperature for 15 minutes. Add the chiles, some of the soaking liquid, the tomato paste, and the broth to a blender and process until smooth. Heat a saucepan over medium-high heat. Add 1 tablespoon of olive oil and the chopped onion. Saute for 3 minutes, then add the garlic and saute for 1 minute. Stir in the raisins, cumin, cinnamon, and cloves; saute 1 minute more. Add the onion mixture, peanut butter, hot sauce and 1/4 cup water to the blender with the chile mixture and process until smooth. Strain. Put the chile mixture, remaining 1 cup of water, and the chocolate into a saucepan. Cook over medium heat, partially covered, stirring occasionally, for 18 minutes, Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the lime juice.<br><br>For the guacamole: Add the avocado flesh to a medium bowl and the onion, jalapeno, lime zest, lime juice and cilantro. Stir and mash to desired consistency. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.<br><br>Heat a grill pan or grill to medium heat. Season both sides of the steak with chipotle powder and salt and pepper. Cook 4 to 5 minutes per side for medium-rare. Meanwhile, warm the tortillas in the microwave.

Stir in the mole sauce and heat until the meat and sauce are warmed through. Arrange a generous portion of the steak mixture in the middle of each warmed tortilla. Top with the guacamole, chipotle creme and cojita cheese<br><br>A viewer, who may not be a professional cook, provided this recipe.
