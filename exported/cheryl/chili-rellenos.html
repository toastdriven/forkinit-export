            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Using a long handled fork, char chiles over an open ﬂame, turning until skins are <br>blackened, 4 to 6 minutes (alternatively, broil chiles on a broiler pan about 2 inches from <br>heat, turning occasionally until skins are blistered and charred).  Transfer chiles to a <br>bowl and let stand, covered, until cool enough to handle.  Using a small knife, carefully <br>scrape the charred skin off the chiles, leaving the stems attached.  <br>Carefully cut a lengthwise slit into each chile to form a pocket, and cut out and discard <br>the seeds.  Stuff each chile with some of the mild cheddar, and thread shut with a <br>toothpick. In a large saucepan, melt enough shortening to reach 1/2 inch up the sides <br>and heat to 375 degrees F on a deep fat thermometer.  <br>Preheat the broiler.  In a bowl, combine ﬂour, salt, and pepper.  In another bowl, <br>carefully fold yolks into egg whites.  Working in batches, dredge the chiles in the ﬂour <br>and, using a slotted spoon, dip into the eggs to coat completely.  Fry, turning <br>occasionally, until golden, no more than a couple of minutes.  Using a slotted spoon, <br>transfer chiles (careful, they are delicate) to a paper towel to drain. <br>Arrange chiles on a ﬂame-proof plate and sprinkle with the sharp cheddar.  Broil chiles <br>just long enough to melt cheese and serve immediately, accompanied by salsa, if <br>desired.
