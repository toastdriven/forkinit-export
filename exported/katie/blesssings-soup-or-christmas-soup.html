            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Place the Kielbasa into a 7-quart Dutch oven and set over medium-low heat.  Cook until the kielbasa has browned well and rendered its fat, approximately 15 minutes. (If you do not have at least 2 teaspoons of fat, add enough vegetable oil to make 2 teaspoons.) Remove the kielbasa from the pan and set aside.<br><br>Add the garlic and cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly to prevent the garlic from burning.  Add the beans and the chicken broth and cook, covered for 45 minutes.  After 45 minutes, add the potatoes, cover and cook for 15 minutes, stirring constantly.<br><br>Add the red wine vinegar and black pepper and stir to combine.  Add kielbasa to pot. Simmer for an hour.<br><br>Wash, rinse and trim the kale and tear into bite-size pieces.  Add the kale to the pot 20-30 minutes before serving, allowing the kale to cook just until tender and not mushy.<br><br>Counsel from others who have made this recipe - <br>Use a little less vinegar than recommended.  <br>Try a bit of onion with the garlic.
