            excellent taste, simple to prepare. I use stew beef rather than short ribs (no fat to trim)

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                In a large casserole or Dutch over, bring beef, water, carrots, onions, celery, bay leaf, slat and pepper to boil.  Reduce heat; cover and simmer 2 1/2 hours until beef is tender.<br><br>If using short ribs, remove meat; separate from bones; return meat to casserole.  If not, cover and refrigerate overnight.<br><br>Remove from refrigerator; put on stove and bring to simmer.  Add beets, tomatoes and lemon juice.  Cover and simmer 15 minutes.  Add cabbage; cook 5-10 minutes or until beets and cabbage are tender.<br><br>My soup was very red from the beets.  Everyone enjoyed to flavor!
