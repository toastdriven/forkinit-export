            <h3 class="underline">Ingredients</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1/4 cup Coconut Oil (I used Spectrum Brand expeller pressed, organic coconut oil)<br><br>2 NOW brand Soy Lecithin capsules<br><br>3 Tablespoons Ghirardelli&#x27;s 100% all Natural Cocoa Powder (DO NOT use Dutch processed/alkali rinsed cocoas. They don&#x27;t taste as good, and the processing strips some of the nutrients out of the cocoa)<br><br>1/8 teaspoon Stevia, powdered (look at ingredients and make sure you get only Stevia, or Stevia with inulin fiber, it feeds good stomach probiotics)<br><br>1 teaspoon Vanilla<br><br>1/4 cup all natural smooth Peanut Butter (I chose one with 2g sugar, and 7g carbs, it had more fiber and less sodium than others)<br><br>1 cup plain unsweetened Soy Milk (preferably organic)<br><br>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1.  Melt coconut oil in medium-size saucepan; turn off heat<br>2.  Set 2 lecithin capsules in a small dish of HOT tap water; as lecithin begins seeping from capsule, add to the coconut oil by squeezing capsules (This can get messy, but I haven&#x27;t found another way to do this. To get lecithin off hands, I immediately squirt hand/dish soap on hands, rub vigorously, and rinse)<br>3. Whisk in cocoa, stevia, vanilla<br>4. Mix in peanut butter <br>5. Slowly add soy milk; if it is not mixing in well, put pan back on low heat. Continue stirring until all is smoothly mixed in.<br>6. Once mixture is cooled, pour into popsicle mold. (I used 2oz molds)<br>7. Freeze approximately 2 hours. They should feel &#x27;rock&#x27; solid when ready.<br>8. Enjoy!<br><br>*9. If I want to make large quantities, I will take the fudgesicles out of molds, wrap them in parchment paper, place them in a ziploc bag, and use the molds for the next batch. :)<br>
