            Simple and yummy especially if you can find meaty short ribs.  Look and ask at a good meat/butcher shop.

                1/2 cup low-sodium soy sauce<br>1/3 cup brown sugar<br>1/4 cup rice vinegar<br>2 cloves garlic, peeled and smashed or minced<br>1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger<br>1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper<br>8 beef short ribs (about 4 pounds)<br>4 medium carrots, peeled and halved crosswise<br>1 cabbage - at least 2 pounds<br>2 tablespoons cornstarch<br>1 tablespoon sesame oil (optional)<br>4 scallions, thinly sliced (optional)<br><br>

            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                In a 4-6-quart slow cooker, combine the soy sauce, sugar, vinegar, garlic, ginger and red pepper.  Add the short ribs and carrots and arrange in a single layer. Lay the cabbage on top.<br><br>Cook covered, on high for 5 to 6 hour (or on low for 7 to 8 hours)*, until the meat is tender and easily pulls away from the bone.<br><br>Transfer the cabbage, short ribs, and carrots to serving platter.  Pour the liquid into a medium-sized sauce pan. Put on medium heat. Add a 1/4 teaspoon of baking powder. In a small bowl, whisk together the cornstarch with 1-3 tablespoons of water until smooth. Whisk into the cooking liquid and cook until thickened, 2 to 3 minutes.  Stir in the sesame oil. (optional)  <br><br>Sauce may be spooned over the short ribs and vegetables or as a gravy over brown rice.<br><br>*Because different slow-cooker models cook at different rates, the total time is presented as a range.  Check for doneness at the low end of the range (but not before, or the escaping heat will slow the cooking.)  If the food is not done, continue cooking to the end of the suggested range.<br>
