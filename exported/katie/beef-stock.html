            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Preheat oven to very hot, about 500 degrees.  Place bones in a single layer in a roasting pan. Break carrots and celery into large pieces and sprinkle among the bones, ditto with the onions.  Roast for 30-45 minutes until meat, bones, and vegetables begin to brown, even burn a little.<br>Dump these into a deep stock pot (16-20 quart).  Pour about a half inch of water into the roasting pan and dissolve any bits which have stuck to the bottom of the pan.  Pour over bones.<br>Bring to boil and stir in tomato paste.  Add parsley, thyme, peppercorns, and garlic.  Cook, barely simmering, for several hours, adding more hot water as necessary.  <br>Strain and boil slowly until reduced and flavor is intensified.<br>Allow to cool and skim any fat from the top.  Refrigerate, rightly covered, or freeze.
