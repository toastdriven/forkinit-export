            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Select a stock pot large enough to comfortably hold all the above ingredients.  Place the chicken, veal knuckle, and water in pot and bring to boil.  Skim foam, and add all other ingredients.  Bring back to boil and reduce to the lowest possible heat; you want this to be barely simmering.  Continue cooking for about 2 1/2 hours, skimming occasionally as necessary.<br>Strain the cooked stock through a damp cheesecloth-lined colander.  Discard all solids. cool and refrigerate the stock.  When fat has congealed on top, remove and discard it.  The stock may be used as is or frozen.
