            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. Start by putting the 1/2 cup peanut butter into a medium size mixing bowl. <br>2. Add the cocoa powder and stevia, mix in thoroughly (using sturdy fork and/or small spatula).<br>3. Set 2 lecithin capsules in a small dish of HOT tap water; as lecithin begins seeping from capsule, add to the bowl by squeezing capsules. (This can get messy, but I haven&#x27;t found another way to do this. To get lecithin off hands, I immediately squirt hand/dish soap on hands, rub vigorously, and rinse)<br>4. Add a teaspoon of vanilla, mix in.<br>5. Add the Soy Milk, and stir carefully until smoothly blended. It won&#x27;t stir smoothly at first and has a tendency to fling contents out of bowl. :)<br>6. Spread on a cracker, veggie, or fruit. Or just eat with a spoon!<br>7. Enjoy!<br><br>*8. If you like coconut, you can also add non-sweetened coconut shavings to the amount that you like. That tastes wonderful as well. :)<br>
