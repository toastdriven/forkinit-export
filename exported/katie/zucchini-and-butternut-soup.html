            <h3 class="underline">Instructions</h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Preheat oven to 375 degrees.<br>Melt butter in a large, deep pot with a lid and add leeks, onions, carrots, and garlic. Toss well, then sprinkle sugar over all and cover tightly. Sweat over the lowest possible heat for 20 minutes. Do not allow to burn.<br>Place butternut squash in a foil-lined pie pan or glass baking dish and bake until fork tender, about 30-40 minutes.<br>When the vegetables in the pot are cooked, add zucchini and 2 cups of the stock plus the white pepper, salt and coriander. Cook uncovered, over medium heat until zucchini is very soft, about 10 minutes. Transfer vegetables and liquid to a food processor.  Scoop out the pulp of the squash, making sure you get it all, and add to the processor mixture.  <br>Puree everything together and return to pot. Stir in balance of the stock and heat.  Adjust seasoning if necessary.  Serve with a dollop of yogurt on top of each serving, if desired.<br><br>Chicken Stock:<br>Select a stockpot large enough to comfortably hold all the above ingredients. Place the chicken, veal knuckle, and water in pot and bring to a boil.  Skim foam, and add all the other ingredients. Bring back to a boil and reduce to the lowest possible heat; you want this to be barely simmering. Continue cooking for about 2 1/2 hours, skimming occasionally as necessary.<br>Strain the cooked stock through a damp cheesecloth-lined colander. Discard all solids.  Cool and refrigerate the stock.  When fat has congealed on top, remove and discard it.  The stock may be used as is or frozen.<br>
