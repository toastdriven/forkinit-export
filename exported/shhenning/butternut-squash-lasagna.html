            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Preheat oven to 375 degrees.<br><br>Saute onion in olive oil until soft. Stir in garlic and greens. If greens are dry, add a little water. Cover and steam 5 minutes or until soft. Set aside.<br><br>Place tofu filling ingredients in food processor or blender. Puree until smooth. Remove bowl and set aside.<br><br>Place sauce ingredients in food processor or blender. Puree until smooth.<br><br>Assemble lasagna as follows: Cover  bottom of 9x13-inch pan with thin layer of sauce ( I use a glass Pyrex dish) Place a single layer of lasagna noodles in bottom of pan. Leave a little space between the noodles as they will expand when cooked. Spread 1/2 of the tofu filling over the noodles. Sprinkle 1/2 of the cooked greens over tofu. Spread 1/3 of the butternut sauce over the greens. Repeat for one more layer. Place noodle layer on top and cover with butternut sauce. Sprinkle chopped nuts over squash.<br><br>Optional: Pour boiling water in corners and around edges of lasagna.<br><br>Cover pan with foil and bake for 35 minutes. Remove cover and bake 10 minutes. Allow to stand 5 to 10 minutes before serving.
