            This can be made from canned tomato juice, canned tomatoes, or fresh tomatoes. It&#x27;s a great way to use up extra tomatoes from the garden. It&#x27;s wonderful served with grilled cheese sandwiches!!! The taste of the tangy tomato with the cheese is delectable!!! Ummmmmm!

                To use canned tomatoes:<br>It would probably take about 3 small cans of whole or diced tomatoes. Liquify in the blender. Then measure to make 5 3/4 cups and use in place of tomato juice in recipe.<br><br>To use fresh tomatoes:<br>Wash, core, and cut any spots out of fresh tomatoes. Quarter them, then liquify in blender, putting in only a few at the start of each blender load. Measure 5 3/4 cups and use in place of tomato juice in recipe.
