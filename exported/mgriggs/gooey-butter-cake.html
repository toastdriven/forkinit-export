            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Preheat oven to 350. Lightly grease one 9x13 cake pan. Melt butter. Empty cake mix into a large bowl. Stir melted butter, along with one egg, into the cake mix. Press mixture into pan. <br><br>In a large bowl, mix cream cheese, almond extract, confectioners sugar and the remaining two eggs. Beat for three minutes with an electric mixer set on medium high speed. Spread over top of the cake mixture in the pan. Bake at 350 for approximately 35 to 38 minutes until golden brown on top. Allow cake to cool. Dust the top with confectioners sugar. (Cake will be gooey on the top, so don&#x27;t over bake!)<br><br>Cooking Tips<br>Yellow Cake Mix â€“ Do not get the moist or ultra moist cake mix.  The texture for the bottom layer should be like dough, not wet like a traditional cake recipe.  I suggest a generic brand like HyVee or Jiffy Cake Mixes.  You can substitute the yellow cake mix for chocolate if you prefer a Chocolate Gooey Butter Cake. <br>  <br>Be careful not to over bake.  Oven temperatures vary so take out of the oven when the top is a light golden brown (my oven gets it done in 31 to 32 minutes).  The center will be gooey so insert the toothpick along the side where the cake has risen to see if bottom layer is done.  <br><br>Enjoy!<br>
