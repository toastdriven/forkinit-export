            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                <br>Position a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 425Â°. In a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the shallots and cook until softened, about 1 minute. Add the ham and cook, stirring occasionally, until heated through, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl.<br><br>Return the skillet to medium heat and add the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Add the mushrooms, sprinkle with garlic powder and cook, stirring occasionally, until their liquid is cooked off, 6 to 8 minutes. Stir into the ham mixture along with the cream cheese.<br><br>Stir the mustard into the beaten eggs and season with a pinch salt.<br><br>Center a piecrust round over a 9-inch pie plate, pressing the dough into the sides and bottom. Fill with the ham mixture, spreading it evenly. Pour in the mustard-egg mixture, tilting the plate to distribute evenly. Cover completely with the tomato halves, cut side down.<br><br>Cover with second pie crust. Cut vent holes in top crust. Trim off any excess ends. Roll the rim of the bottom crust up over the lattice and crimp. <br><br>Transfer the pie to a baking sheet and bake until the egg mixture is set, about 50 minutes. Let cool for 30 minutes before serving.
