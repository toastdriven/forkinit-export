            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                To make the pasta:<br>I use my KitchenAid mixer with Pasta attachment, but you can roll out the dough and slice it into ribbons.<br>scoop 1 cup flour (I use whole wheat but you can use white flour if you prefer) into a medium bowl. Create a depression in the flour. Crack two eggs into the depression add a dash of salt and start to stir the eggs into the flour using your fingers. Once all the flour is mixed in kneed the dough until it is no longer tacky. Add more flour by dashes if it is needed. The dough ball should be rubbery. Break the dough ball into marble sized chunks and drop into your pasta maker hopper. Or roll very thin on a floured surface and cut into 1/4 inch strips. Hang to dry for an hour or so.<br><br>To make Spinach mix:<br>Thaw the Spinach <br>slice the shallot thinly<br>chop the garlic<br>saut√© the spinach, garlic, and shallot in 3T of Olive oil<br><br>Bring a pot of water to a boil. Cook pasta until al dente. Drain pasta and toss with Spinach mix.
