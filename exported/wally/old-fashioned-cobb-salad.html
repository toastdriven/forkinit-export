            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                1. Finely chop iceberg lettuce, watercress, frisée and romaine lettuce. Place in a large salad bowl.<br><br>2. Arrange cherry tomatoes, chicken, bacon, eggs, cheese and freshly diced avocados in mounds, attractively spaced, on top of the greens. You may want to divide each ingredient into two smaller mounds, but the final result should be visually pleasing.<br><br>3. Sprinkle chives over entire platter.<br><br>4. When ready to eat, present salad at the table, and toss with enough dressing to moisten and flavor. Season with salt and pepper, if needed.
