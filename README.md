# Forkinit Recipe Export

This is an export of all the recipes added to **Forkinit.com** between
2009 &ndash; 2022. The site is no longer operational, but this export has been
created for the users to continue to have access to their data.

We'd like to thank everyone for their support & willingness to
try out new ideas with us. It's unfortunate the site never took
off the way we hoped, but we're appreciative nonetheless.

_&mdash; Xian, Matt & Daniel_
